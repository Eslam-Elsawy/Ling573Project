      Canada vehemently condemned Monday's suicide attack in Israel and said it should not be allowed to derail the Middle East peace process.

      The blast, at a shopping mall near Israel's top-secret nuclear reactor, was the first suicide bombing on Israeli soil since the relaunch of peace talks at a US conference in November and the first since January last year.

      "This cowardly incident is another reminder that terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed. Those who choose to use terrorist violence only damage the cause they claim to represent," Canadian Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier said.

      "Such acts must not be allowed to undermine the peace process," Bernier said in a statement, adding the priority of the parties "must remain to continue their negotiations toward peace."

      One Israeli woman was killed and at least 11 people wounded in the bombing, which triggered scenes of panic in the desert town of Dimona.

      Medics said one suicide bomber was killed in the blast and a second was killed by police shortly after the explosion.

      The attack came after a near two-week breach of the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip which saw hundreds of thousands of people pouring into Egypt from the impoverished Hamas-run territory in a bid to break a crippling Israeli siege.

      Israeli authorities have voiced concern that militants could have entered the country through its porous 250-kilometre (150-mile) border with the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.
