      Meanwhile, Israeli sources believed that the assailants have succeeded in infiltrating southern Israel from Sinai when Hamas militants blew up Gaza-Egypt border on Jan. 23 and allowed floods of Palestinians into Egypt's Sinai Peninsular.

      Stressing that the suicide bombers entered Israel from Gaza, the spokesman said the Israeli claims that they crossed from Sinai was meant at "exporting Israel's crisis to Egypt."
