      More vitamin D might mean less risk.

      THE QUESTION Colorectal cancer seems to occur more often among those who live in sunshine-deprived areas, leading some people to theorize that the lack of vitamin D (which sun helps the body absorb) may play a role in the disease. Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?

     <p>
      THIS STUDY combined and analyzed data from five studies, involving 1,448 healthy people whose blood was tested for the presence of the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, the main form of vitamin D in the circulatory system. The participants' health was monitored for up to 25 years. During that time, those whose blood registered the highest levels of vitamin D were the least likely to develop colorectal cancer. For example, people with a 25(OH)D blood level of 33 nanograms per milliliter or higher were 50 percent less likely to have developed colorectal cancer than were those with a level of 12 ng/ml or lower. The study estimated that taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml.

      WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE FINDINGS? Anyone concerned about colorectal cancer. More than 90 percent of diagnoses occur after age 50. Cause of the disease is unknown, but contributing factors appear to include family history, smoking and diet.

      CAVEATS All participants in the studies were whether the findings apply to others is unclear. The study reported a possible association between the vitamin and cancer, not a cause-and-effect relationship.

      The research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals. Nonetheless, conclusive evidence about a treatment's effectiveness is rarely found in a single study. Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician.
