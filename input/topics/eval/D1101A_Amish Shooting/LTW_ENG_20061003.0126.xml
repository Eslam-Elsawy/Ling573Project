      He was a soccer dad, and a quiet hard-working, church-going family man.

      So those who knew Charlie Roberts were in a state of shock Monday when authorities named him as the suicidal gunman who shot a classroom full of girls, execution style, in a tiny Amish schoolhouse.
     </p>

      ``The man who did this today is not the Charlie that I've been married to for almost 10 years,'' said Marie Roberts, 28, the alleged gunman's widow, in a statement released to the media.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``My husband is loving, supportive, thoughtful, all the things you'd always want and more.''
     </p>

      Charles Carl Roberts IV, 32, held a steady job working nights driving a truck that collected milk from area dairy farms. According to a driver who worked with Roberts, those farms included some where the children in the school lived.

      ``I imagine he knew some of these kids,'' said Ray Shirk, 60.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to media reports, the gunman was not Amish and had not attended the school.
     </p>
     <p>
      Roberts, his wife andchildren, two boys and three girls ages about 1 to 7, lived in the tiny village of Georgetown, about 55 miles west of Philadelphia and a short drive from the school.

      After taking his school-aged children to their bus stop Monday, as usual, Roberts drove a borrowed pickup to the entrance of the rural West Nickel Mines Amish School around 9 a.m. The shootings occurred about 10:45 a.m.
     </p>
     <p>
      Police could offer no explanation for the killings. Roberts left what they described as rambling notes for his family.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the siege, he called his wife to say he felt tormented and sought vengeance for some unspecified 20-year-old offense that he evidently had brooded over since he was about 12.

      In her statement, Marie Roberts called her husband ``an exceptional father'' who took his children to soccer practice, played ball in the backyard and took his 7-year-old daughter shopping.
     </p>
     <p>
      She pleaded for people to pray for the families of the slain, as well as her own.

      Roberts hauled milk for the Northwest Food Products Transfer Station in East Earl, Pa., which is owned by the Land O'Lakes dairy cooperative. He had delivered milk for at least seven years, one neighbor said.

      The Roberts' house, next to a Methodist church and graveyard, was deserted Monday.

      There was a plastic child's basketball hoop on a deck, along with four straw Halloween scarecrows. The smallest scarecrow wore an infant's green jumpsuit. The family's two dogs were gone.

      Morgan Erb, 15, baby-sat for the Roberts family in the summer of 2005. She said the truck driver was a ``nice'' man who never seemed threatening but seldom spoke.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several of other neighbors said they had never seen Roberts angry. ``I can't believe it,'' said Mary Fischer, who lives next door. Roberts was the driver who picked up milk from her son's dairy. ``I have never heard him say an angry word.''
     </p>
     <p>
      One Amish family recalled how he accidentally ran over their wheelbarrow with his milk-hauling rig. He knocked on their doors and calmly told them about the incident.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another driver, they said, might have been angry that the implement was left where the delivery truck would hit it in the dark.
