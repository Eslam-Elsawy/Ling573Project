      About 300 representatives from five international conservation bodies and more than 60 countries and regions gathered in the Japanese port city of Kobe on Monday for a five-day meeting to talk about optimal and sustainable ways to strengthen the conservation of tuna as the stocks are rapidly declining due to overfishing.

      In a speech at the opening ceremony, Japanese Fisheries Agency Director General Toshiro Shirasu warned that the tuna stocks have been overfished across the oceans, and he called on fishing industries across the world to tackle the problem with a global point of view.

      Issues such as sharing of information on illegal fishing vessels and studying stricter restrictions on purse seine fishing are among major topics of the Joint Meeting of Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, the first ever such meeting. It is proposed by Japan and organized by the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.

      The five bodies are expected to adopt an action plan to further harmonize their conservation and management measures for tuna stocks on the ending day, Kyodo News said.

      The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's senior fishery statistician, Sachiko Tsuji, warned that the absence of a proper data collection system may hinder global efforts for the well use of tuna stocks.

      She said the failure to have a correct judgment of the scale of overfishing and the lack of an appropriate systems to collect various data, including those on port, trade and market controls, could lead to management failure.

      The World Wildlife Fund, an environmental group which joined the meeting as an observer, warned in a statement that populations of important species such as bluefin tuna are "critically depleted " despite efforts by some governments.

      Experts also pointed out at the meeting that world demand for tuna has been on a rise since developing countries like China are adding the burden on global tuna stocks.
