      A burning Jeep Cherokee crashed into the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport on Saturday afternoon. Two people in the car, including one suffering severe burns, were arrested and the airport was evacuated and closed following the incident.

      He reassured people that it is right to raise the security level at airports and crowded places.

      "The British people must remain united, resolute and strong," he said after chairing a meeting with security officers.

      The highest security alert level means imminent attack is expected.

      Britain's Home Office has also ordered security to be tightened across the country.
