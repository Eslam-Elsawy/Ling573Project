      "The rain will bring trouble to the earthquake relief work," it said.

      In addition, experts from the meteorological observatory pointed out that soil and rock structures had been loosened by the earthquake.

      Along with rain, "geological disasters such as debris flow, landslides, etc. will probably occur," they warned.

      "Therefore, the relevant sectors and personnel should pay attention to disaster prevention as well as disaster resistance and relief."
