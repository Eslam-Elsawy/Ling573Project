      Monsoon floods ravaging Bangladesh for more than a week have killed about 40 people and displaced or marooned millions, relief officials said Wednesday.

      More than a third of Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation of 145 million people, has been inundated by floods, the Food and Disaster Management Ministry said. At least 5 million people have either been marooned or displaced in the country's hardest-hit northern region.

      The ministry did not specify the number of flood-related deaths, but relief officials said at least 40 people died in the past week.

      Many of the dead were children who drowned, relief officials said on condition of anonymity, as they were not allowed to speak to the media.

      Bangladesh is hammered by monsoon floods that kill hundreds every year and destroy homes and crops.

      The River Jamuna breached its banks this week, inundating much of Sirajganj, a small town 104 kilometers (64 miles) northwest of the national capital Dhaka.

      Schools and some government offices have been closed as streets were under waist-high water, local officials said.

      Many displaced people have taken shelter on embankments, while others have moved onto rooftops of their houses. Residents are using small boats to get around.

      On Wednesday, Fakhruddin Ahmed, the head of the country's military-backed interim government, toured by helicopter some of the flood-hit areas in the north and promised to help to the victims.

      "We know that you are suffering. Our government will do everything possible to reduce your miseries," Ahmed said.
