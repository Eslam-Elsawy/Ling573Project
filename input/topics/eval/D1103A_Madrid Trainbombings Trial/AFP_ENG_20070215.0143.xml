      The trial opened Thursday of 29 suspects charged with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people in one of Europe's worst terror strikes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prosecution alleges that the March 11 attacks, which left more than 1,800 injured, were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al- Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq.

      The trial, which opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid, is expected to hear evidence from some 600 witnesses and around 100 experts, and to last some five months before an October verdict.
     </p>

      The proceedings began with one of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias "Mohammed the Egyptian," rejecting all charges against him and refusing to give evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      The blasts on four packed commuter trains were the biggest in the Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.

      Squadrons of police were outside the court, many of them armed, others with dogs, while a helicopter flew overhead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accused were brought to the venue in two armoured police vans, which arrived with sirens wailing.

      "It's going to be difficult to look in the eye those who destroyed my life but I will do it for my son," said Pilar Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who chairs a victim support association.
     </p>
     <p>
      "My legs are trembling, I'm afraid. My stomach is churning," said a tearful Manjon, who briefly addressed reporters and emotionally embraced her lawyer before heading into court.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Mohammed the Egyptian" is alleged to have boasted in intercepted telephone calls that the whole Madrid operation was "my idea."
     </p>
     <p>
      He is one of seven defendants facing sentences of some 40,000 years each for the deaths and membership of a terrorist organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term anyone can actually serve is 40 years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including collaboration with a terrorist group.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dozens of survivors and relatives of the victims will follow the proceedings on the spot, some in the courtroom itself but mostly from a separate room where they will watch on a flatscreen.
     </p>
     <p>
      A just-released report by psychiatrists and social workers involved with helping the survivors and relatives overcome their trauma showed that almost one in five survivors have not been on a train since.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accused were to give evidence from a bullet-proof box.
     </p>
     <p>
      The four alleged masterminds spent a year planning the worst terror attack in Europe since the December 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three of the four will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj, alias "the Afghan" and Hassan el-Haski, alias "Abu Hamza."
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven men who "led and coordinated" the attacks blew themselves up in a police raid three weeks later.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prosecution says the "final detonator" for the train bombings was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin Laden naming Spain as a potential target.
