      An 18-year-old student opened fire in a high school in southern Finland on Wednesday, killing eight people including the principal before turning the gun on himself, police said.

      The man, who was not identified, shot himself in the head, but survived and was taken to a hospital in "extremely critical condition," police spokesman Tero Haapala said.

      The shooting at Jokela High School in Tuusula, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the capital, Helsinki, shocked the Nordic nation because gun violence is rare.

      Police said at a news conference after the attack that the gunman shot the victims with a .22-caliber pistol. About a dozen other people were injured in the incident as they tried to escape the school, police said.

      "He was from an ordinary family," police chief Matti Tohkanen said about the gunman, who got a license for the pistol Oct. 19 and did not have a previous criminal record.

      Finnish media said the shooter revealed his plans in a YouTube posting before the attack.

      The video, titled "Jokela High School Massacre," showed a picture of a building by a lake and two photos of a young man holding a handgun. The person who posted the video was identified in the user profile as an 18-year-old man from Finland. The posting was later removed.

      The profile contained a text calling for a "revolution against the system."

      Police could not immediately be reached to comment on the video.

      Kim Kiuru, a teacher at the school, said the principal announced over the public address system just before noon (1000GMT) that all students should remain in their classrooms.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I stayed in the corridor to listen to more instructions, having locked my classroom door," Kiuru told the YLE radio station. "After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small caliber handgun in his hand through the doors toward me after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction."
     </p>
     <p>
      Kiuru said he saw a woman's body as he fled the building.
     </p>

      "Then my pupils shouted at me out of the windows to ask what they should do and I told them to jump out of the windows ... and all my pupils were saved," Kiuru said.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was the first reported incident of a shooting at a Finnish school, where previous violent incidents usually involved knives but had never resulted in death.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 400 students aged 12 through 18 were enrolled at Jokela, Hagman said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described the situation as "extremely tragic" and said the government would hold an emergency meeting.
