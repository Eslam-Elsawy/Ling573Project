      Johnson Johnson on Thursday voluntarily recalled certain infant cough and cold products, citing "rare" instances of misuse leading to overdoses.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a statement, JnJ's McNeil-PPC unit said the misuse could lead to overdoses "particularly in infants under two years of age."

      The products being recalled include infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Concentrated Infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Cold Pediacare Infant Drops Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant Pediacare Infant Dropper Pediacare Infant Dropper Long-Acting and Pediacare Infant Dropper Decongestant Cough (PE) products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cough and cold products for children age 2 and over and single-ingredient pain reliever and fever reducers expressly labeled for infants are not included in the recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recall comes two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public health advisory warning parents not to give cough and cold medications to children under 2 years of age without a doctor's direction.

      The FDA's Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 18-19 to discuss the use of cough and cold drugs by children.
