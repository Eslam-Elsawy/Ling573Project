      The accident occurred at 07:15 a.m. local time (2215 GMT Thursday) in waters 6 miles northwest off the seashore of Taean Peninsula, South Chungcheon Province when the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Sprit collided with a South Korean barge ship, the maritime police said.

      According to the coast guard, the Hebei Spirit was registered in Hong Kong, while the barge ship belongs to a South Korean company. The tanker was at anchor when the South Korean barge ship hit into the larboard of the oil tanker and punctured three holes in the tanker.
