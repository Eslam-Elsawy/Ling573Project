      A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea Friday after being holed by a barge in what officials said was South Korea's worst oil spill.

      "We are worried about an ecological disaster," said Kim Jong-Sik, an official with the ministry of maritime affairs and fisheries, adding: "This is the country's worst oil spill.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have set up a boom, trying to stop oil from spreading along the coast, but oil sometimes overflows it depending on the currents."
     </p>
     <p>
      The Hong Kong-registered tanker Hebei Spirit, carrying about 15,000 tons of oil, was berthed five miles off Mallipo, 90 kilometres (54 miles) southwest of Seoul, when it was pierced in three places.

      The ministry said the spillage might be greater than the estimated 10,000 tons. It said operations had been hampered by strong winds and the danger of an explosion.

      Three small tankers were sent to pump the remaining oil from the single-hull tanker.

      "Oil is still spewing from three holes on the tanker's port side. A slick of spilt oil stretches five kilometres, threatening marine farms in the region," Kim said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "If we fail to contain the spread, it is feared (it will) inflict serious damage to the coast," he said.
     </p>

      The barge, which had a crane onboard to build a bridge in the western port city of Incheon, was being towed by another vessel.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Our initial investigation showed loose ropes linked to the towing vessel might have caused the accident," Kim told AFP.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yonhap news agency said the tow rope broke in strong winds and high waves.
     </p>
     <p>
      The spill triggered an emergency operation by about 40 coastguard and other ships as well as four helicopters, said maritime ministry officials who have set up a crisis centre.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ministry said dozens of vessels in other regions had been asked to join the operation.
     </p>

      The tanker was anchored near waters designated as a national park before sailing into Daesan port to discharge its cargo. The west coast is one of Asia's largest wetland areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the previous worst incident in South Korea, a tanker hit a rock in 1995 and spilt 5,000 tones of oil onto the south coast, causing damage estimated at 44.3-billion won (48-million dollars).
     </p>

      In addition, the government spent more than 22-billion won on a five-month operation to clean up the south coast.
