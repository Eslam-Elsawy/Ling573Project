      British Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Tuesday condemned the near- simultaneous bombings in the Indian city of Jaipur that killed at least 80 people.

      "Today's bombings in Jaipur have shown again the horrific destruction which terrorism brings," Miliband said in a statement.

      "My thoughts are with the families of the victims and with those injured. There can never be any justification for acts of indiscriminate violence such as these, and I utterly condemn those who have perpetrated today's attacks."

      Seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other, tearing apart markets, in what Indian police described as a "terror attack."

      Miliband said Britain "stands and will continue to stand with the government and people of India against terrorism in all its manifestations."
