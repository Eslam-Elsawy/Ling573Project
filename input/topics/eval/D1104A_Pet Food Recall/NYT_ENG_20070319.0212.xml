     TESTS BY PET FOOD MAKER KILLED 7 ANIMALS BEFORE RECALL

      Of the 10 cats and dogs whose deaths have been linked to pet food that was recalled over the weekend, seven died last month in a taste test conducted by the manufacturer, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday.

      The company, Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario, started testing its product on 40 to 50 animals on Feb. 27, one week after it began hearing from owners who said the food had made their pets ill, said Stephen Sundlof, director of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine.

      The company alerted the FDA to its findings last week, and the agency has since opened a full investigation, Sundlof said. All the animals that ultimately died had begun showing signs of kidney failure, the agency said.

      In addition to those seven tested animals, at least three pets have died after eating contaminated food, Sundlof said, and the number is expected to rise as officials work to confirm the number of deaths.

      Menu Foods manufactures products for brand-name companies including Eukanuba, Iams and Science Diet, as well as some store brands for companies including Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie, Hannaford and Price Chopper. The full list is available from the company at www.menufoods.com/recall.

      The FDA is focusing on contamination of wheat gluten, a protein used as filler in the foods' manufacture. Menu Foods and Sundlof said the timing of the illnesses coincided with a point at which the company started using a new wheat gluten supplier.

      Sarah Tuite, a spokeswoman for Menu Foods, said: "We just don't know exactly what's causing the problems. All we know is the illness coincided with the introduction of a new supplier. I think we're looking at everything right now."
     </p>
     <p>
      Sundlof would not identify the supplier other than to say it dealt only with manufacturers of pet food and had plants in Kansas City, Mo., and New Jersey. Most of the contaminated lots originated at the Kansas City plant, he said.

      "We don't have any information that any other manufacturer has been supplied ingredients from this particular supplier," he said. "We are working feverishly to determine that."
     </p>
     <p>
      Sundlof urged people who think their pet might have been affected to contact their local FDA office and a veterinarian if a pet exhibits symptoms of kidney failure, which include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. Cats are more likely than dogs to be affected, he said.

      Around the country, worried pet owners inundated veterinarian's offices and pet stores with calls Monday, concerned that the food might have sickened their pets.

      Lisa Moses, a staff veterinarian at Angell Animal Medical Center-Boston, said the emergency room had been flooded with owners concerned about their pets. The hospital said that one cat had died and two dogs been stricken with kidney failure in the past week and that it was reviewing all the renal cases it has seen in the past few months.
     </p>

      "People are panic-stricken," Moses said. "This is really scary to people, and I don't blame them."

      In Denver, PetSmart stores were referring customers to manufacturer hotlines, and in San Francisco employees at a cat hospital tried to calm nervous callers.

      Amanda Cassetty, a veterinarian at the Murphy Road Animal Hospital in Nashville, Tenn., said her clinic received about 100 calls from worried pet owners on Saturday and 30 more by mid-afternoon Monday.

      "Pets these days are viewed as family members, and this is something the owner is directly feeding them," she said. "If their pet happened to come down with a disease the owners would tend to feel guilty because they're the ones who fed them."

      Marcella Nelson of Mattapoisett, Mass., changed her cat Tootsie's food to Iams after a checkup on Feb. 5, where her kidney function was tested and came back normal. A week later she became lethargic and would not eat, and a test on Feb. 20 showed Tootsie was suffering from kidney failure and had to be euthanized. Nelson did not throw out the food and said the product numbers matched those in the recall.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The only thing that changed between Feb. 3 and Feb. 20 was that she was put on Iams," Nelson said. "We are angry. We thought we were doing a better thing for our cat, improving her food. You trust these companies that have these reputations."

      Elizabeth Krottinger of Anderson, Texas, usually feeds her five dogs dry food, but bought them wet Natural Choice brand turkey and gravy and chicken and rice as a treat for her mini pincher Minnie's birthday.

      The dogs started to get sick in the days after eating the food March 11, and all were hospitalized last week with kidney damage. They are out of the woods, but might have to have a kidney prescription diet.

      Day Keel of Basking Ridge, N.J., had to euthanize her dog, Soju, March 5 after he suffered from kidney and liver failure, as a result, she believes, of his eating tainted dog food. Soju, a mutt the family adopted while living in Korea, ate Natural Choice chicken with rice and gravy and started vomiting the next day. He was diagnosed with renal failure within a week.
