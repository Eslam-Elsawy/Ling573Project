      A Canadian pet-food supplier recalled some of its dog and cat food Sunday after several pets in the United States died, local media reported.

      Menu Foods, one of North America's largest suppliers of pet food, is recalling dog food sold throughout North America under 48 brands and cat food sold under 40 brands including Iams, Nutro and Eukanuba, a report by Canadian Press said.

      The recall follows complaints that one dog and several cats in the United States died of kidney failure after eating the foods.

      Paul Henderson, the CEO of the Toronto-area company, says it is not clear what the problem is and the recall is precautionary.

      "We've undertaken a battery of technical tests ... and all of those tests have failed to identify any issues at all with our product," he said.

      Company spokesperson Sarah Tuite has said the recalled products were made using wheat gluten purchased from a new supplier, which has since been dropped for another source. Wheat gluten is a source of protein.

      U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesperson Julie Zawisza said it is still too early to determine what could have affected the food. She said that even if wheat gluten is the source, it could be another substance associated with the wheat gluten.

      Menu Foods said it has beefed up the testing of all raw materials and finished goods.
