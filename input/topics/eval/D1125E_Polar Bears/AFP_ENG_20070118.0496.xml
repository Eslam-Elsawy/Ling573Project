      Greenland on Thursday said it would cut its annual quota for its polar bear hunt as the animal was threatened by climate change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt, shrinking the bears' hunting grounds and making it increasingly difficult for them to find food.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
     </p>
     <p>
      The quota for 2007 has now been reduced to 139 in the semi-autonomous Danish territory.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have decided on this reduction in the 2007 quota to be more in line with a level suggested by biologists, who wanted an even lower number," a ministry of fisheries and hunting official, Ole Heinrich, told AFP.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision was taken after consultation with local authorities and the Greenland Hunters and Fishers Association (KNAPK), said Heinrich, who spoke to AFP by telephone from Greenland's capital Nuuk.
     </p>
     <p>
      KNAPK president John Billmann criticised the authorities for not having stuck to plans to allow the killing of 203 bears.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only hunters who are granted special permits are allowed to hunt polar bears. The hunting of bear cubs and pregnant bears is banned.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a complete ban on the hunting of polar bears between July 1 and September 30.
