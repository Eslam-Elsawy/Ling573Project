      A British investment fund that counted itself a client of alleged Wall Street fraudster Bernard Madoff criticised the "systemic failure" of regulators in the United States on Sunday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bramdean Alternatives Limited said the accusations against Madoff raised "fundamental questions" about the American financial regulatory system.

      "It is astonishing that this apparent fraud seems to have been continuing for so long, possibly for decades, while investors have continued to invest more money into the Madoff funds in good faith," the firm said in a statement.
     </p>
     <p>
      It added: "The allegations made appear to point to a systemic failure of the regulatory and securities markets regime in the US."
     </p>
     <p>
      The company said the "apparent failure raises fundamental questions about the regulatory system under which this has happened and no doubt this will be the subject of intense debate as the facts emerge."
     </p>
     <p>
      Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
     </p>
     <p>
      Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme, with prosecutors alleging that the 70-year-old, a decades- long veteran of Wall Street, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme.

      "Most investors, including ourselves, regarded the Madoff strategy as offering a stable source of returns," Nicola Horlick, Bramdean's chief executive, was quoted as saying in Britain's Sunday Telegraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Yet it seems criminal activity has continued undetected for years."
     </p>
     <p>
      Several British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz, one of Britain's richest men, who apparently invested 40 million pounds with the firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sunday Telegraph also reported, citing experts, that British pension funds and insurance companies invested in Madoff's company.
     </p>
     <p>
      A spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP on Sunday that the bank had "some exposure" to Madoff's company, but declined to give details.
     </p>
     <p>
      HSBC, meanwhile, declined to confirm any relationship with the alleged fraudster.
