      The United States and southern Europe will be far better prepared than the poor nations of Africa to deal with more frequent drought.

      For the U.S., the biggest problem in a future of chronic drought would be water shortages. The seven Colorado basin states -- Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California -- would battle each other for diminished Colorado River flows. Mexico, which has a share of the river under a 1944 treaty and has complained of U.S. diversions in the past, would join the conflict.

      Inevitably, water be would reallocated from agriculture, which uses most of the West's supplies, to urban users, drying up farms. California would come under pressure to build desalination plants on the coast, despite environmental concerns.

      ``This is a situation that is going to cause water wars,'' said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.

      ``If there's not enough water to meet everybody's allocation, how do you divide it up?''

      Officials from seven states recently forged a agreement about how to handle the current drought, which has left the Colorado River's big reservoirs -- Lake Powell and Lake Mead -- roughly half empty. Without some very wet years, federal water managers say Lake Mead may never completely refill.
