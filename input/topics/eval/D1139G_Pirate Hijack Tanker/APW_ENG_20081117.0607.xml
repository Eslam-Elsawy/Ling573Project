      Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.

      The hijacking was the latest in a surge in Somali pirate attacks this year and highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships moving through the area.

      The tanker, owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is 330 meters (1,080 feet), about the length of an aircraft carrier. It can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.

      Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said the Sirius Star was carrying crude at the time of hijacking, but he did know how much. He also had no details about where the ship was sailing from and where it was headed.

      The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag. The 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.

      Christensen said the pirates hijacked the vessel on Saturday.

      In a news release sent out on Monday from the 5th Fleet's Middle East headquarters in Bahrain, the Navy said the large crude tanker Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.

      A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the MV Sirius Star, but said he could offer no further details on the ship or what had happened to it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Sirius Star was built in South Korea's Daewoo shipping yards and commissioned in March. Classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the ship is 318,000 dead weight tons.

      An operator with Aramco said there was no one available at the company to comment after business hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Calls went unanswered at Vela international, the Dubai-based marine company that operated the ship for Aramco.
     </p>
     <p>
      As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers.
