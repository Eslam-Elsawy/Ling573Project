      Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The announcement of the number infections comes a day after Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ordered an investigation into the microbicide clinical trials in the eastern KwaZulu Natal province.

      "We have found that about 22 women from the 604 participants at the trial site in KwaZulu-Natal were infected by the AIDS virus," health spokesman, Sibani Mngadi told AFP.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We are investigating whether these women were infected as a result of the use of the microbicide, Ushercell," added Mngadi.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tshabalala-Msimang said a thorough investigation was needed to establish if participants in the trial process had been properly informed about the risks.

      "I have asked a thorough investigation into this matter to establish whether the study followed all protocols approved by the Medicine Control Council," she said after a meeting with local scientists.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We also are investigating whether the participants were given sufficient information to make informed decisions about their participation."
     </p>

      It was announced by the World Health Organisation last week that two out of six advanced trials of the vaginal microbicides gels had been stopped for safety reasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Researchers testing cellulose sulphate found that women who used the gel ran a higher risk of HIV infection compared with those who used a dummy lookalike, or placebo. As a precaution, another trial using this compound was stopped.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cellulose sulphate, also called Ushercell, was in Phase III trials, the final and biggest step in testing a pharmaceutical innovation for safety and effectiveness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apart from South Africa, the trial had also been conducted in India, Uganda and Benin. A similar trial involving cellulose sulphate was stopped in Nigeria as a precaution, although there was no data to suggest that there was any risk.
     </p>
     <p>
      South Africa's main anti-AIDS lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said the halting of microbicide trials was a "setback".
     </p>
     <p>
      "The termination of the Ushercell trials is a setback for microbicide research," the TAC said in a statement. "It is unlikely that a succesful microbicide will be found in the next few years and it is possible that other ongoing microbicide trials will fail.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Nevertheless, science advances by learning from failures and ethical trials of the most promising microbicides should continue because the development of a successful microbicide will likely prevent many HIV infections and save many lives."
     </p>
     <p>
      South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of HIV infections, with more than 5.5 million out of the overall 47 million population affected by the virus.
