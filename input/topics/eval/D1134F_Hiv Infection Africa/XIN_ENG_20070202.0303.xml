      Malawi has started a process of formulating a law that will protect people from deliberate and malicious infection of HIV, a senior government official disclosed on Friday.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The government is just responding to the needs of the people who have been calling for such a law for a very long time," Mary Shawa, principal secretary for HIV/AIDS and nutrition in the president's office told Xinhua.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shawa said the Malawian government had set up a special law commission that would come up with an HIV/AIDS law after consulting the whole country.
     </p>
     <p>
      She said Malawi needed an HIV/AIDS law that would ably protect people from malicious HIV infection especially in cases of rape or other sexual abuses, adding that the current legal framework had huge loopholes in addressing such issues.

      "We need to protect people from such infections that are happening in hospitals, homes and everywhere in the country so that no one gets away with infecting another person deliberately," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shawa could not however state how soon Malawi would have the HIV/AIDS law in place but said the country should have formulated the law some years back.

      The impoverished southern African country, whose total number of HIV infected people currently stands at about 1 million, has about 170,000 infected people who require HIV/AIDS drugs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Malawi, whose population currently stands at about 12 million, loses 80,000 people every year to HIV/AIDS and about 110,000 people catch HIV annually.
     </p>
     <p>
      The country has however managed to increase the number of people receiving free anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) from about 4, 000 two years ago to 80,000 at present.
     </p>
     <p>
      Malawi, like other southern African countries, has seen its life expectancy at birth drop from about 60 in the early 1990s to below 35 presently due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
