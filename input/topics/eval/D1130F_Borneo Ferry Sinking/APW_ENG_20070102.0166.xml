      Bad weather on Tuesday prevented search aircraft from looking for more survivors from an Indonesian ferry that sank in stormy weather as 400 people remained missing days after the disaster.

      Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital were becoming more and more desperate, however, and a temporary morgue was being set up at a port close to where the crowded passenger ship went down Friday just before midnight.

      "I am tired of crying," said Sipan, who goes by only one name, as he waited at Rembang hospital for news of his son. "Dead or alive, I will accept his destiny. It is up to God. All I can do is keep waiting."

      The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's main island of Java.

      Head of the search and rescue mission Jan Simamora said that high winds and poor visibility had prevented helicopters and search planes from taking to the air on Tuesday.

      "For 17 hours we held on, sometimes being turned over in the swell, but one-by-one the people fell off, including my two children," he said. "I could not do anything apart from pray." Waluyo also goes by a single name.

      The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people. Officials say bad weather was the cause of the accident.
