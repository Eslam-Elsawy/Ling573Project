      Dozens of survivors who drifted at sea for three days were picked up by fishing boats Tuesday after a ferry sunk in a storm off central Indonesia, an official said.

      Strong winds and poor visibility prevented search aircraft from taking to the skies to search for about 400 people still missing, but ships continued to patrol the waters off Java, near the site where the boat went down.

      Rescue teams were focused around Madura island, around 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta.

      "Heavy surf and high waves are still hampering our relief efforts, but we believe many survivors are over there, they need our help," said rescue worker Agus Anwari.

      Nearly 200 have been found alive since the ferry sinking and authorities say they will keep searching until Sunday. Thirteen corpses have been recovered and scores of others have been spotted floating at sea, officials said.

      Survivor Susilo, 35, was picked up by fishermen and taken to a hospital with chest pain and respiratory problems along with five others after drifting in a life raft for four days.

      "Six among us died, one by one, due to starvation, cold and after drinking too much sea water," he said.

      Another 27 survivors were rescued elsewhere off the Java coast Tuesday. Air force planes have dropped food and water to some survivors stranded in the Java Sea.

      Weeping relatives camped out at a local hospital, and a temporary morgue was being set up at a port close to where the crowded passenger ship went down late Friday.

      Hundreds of body bags were being prepared.

      The Senopati Nusantara sank after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's main island of Java.

      Head of the search and rescue mission Jan Simamora said that high winds and poor visibility had prevented helicopters and search planes from taking to the air on Tuesday.

      Harrowing tales about the ship's last moments continued to emerge.

      Waluyo, 50, recalled holding onto a large tire and seeing two of his children lose their grip and drown.

      "For 17 hours we held on, sometimes being turned over in the swell, but one by one the people fell off, including my two children," he said. "I could not do anything apart from pray." Waluyo goes by a single name.

      The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people. Officials say bad weather was the cause of the accident.

      Separately, a speed boat capsized in poor weather Monday night off the coast of Borneo island, killing 15, officials said -- the fourth deadly accident in less than a week in the vast archipelago.
