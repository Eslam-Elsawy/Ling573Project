      Ships and rescue teams scoured rough seas off Indonesia for hundreds of people still missing after a ferry disaster off Java island, as more weary survivors were plucked to safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      Navy ships, fishermen and search and rescue teams have found more than 200 survivors since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 on board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Health department officials said they had brought in hundreds of body bags in preparation for the worst but so far there is no official death toll, with fishing boats occasionally finding bodies floating in the sea.
     </p>

      At least 218 people had been rescued by Monday night, the Suara Merdeka newspaper said, quoting a local government search and rescue command post.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some 48 survivors were being brought in on naval and commercial ships, the newspaper based in the Javanese port of Semarang said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transport Minister Hatta Rajasa said the search operation would continue for the hundreds still missing.
     </p>
     <p>
      "If needed, the search will be extended to an unspecified time," he was quoted as saying by the detikcom online news portal.

      The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank. Initial investigations showed bad weather was likely to blame.

      Survivors have said the ship went down in minutes in rough seas as it tried to stabilise itself, leaving the passengers and crew little chance of saving themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Only about 10 minutes after we dropped anchor the ship disappeared. The next thing I knew, I was in the water," deckhand Wawan, 22, told AFP.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I'd floated around since Friday night until the fishermen's boat found me sometime Sunday night, almost midnight," he said in hospital here after being brought in by fishing boat early Monday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fellow survivor Ariyo Tanoto said many were trapped as the ship went down.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I saw the ferry sink in about 10 minutes," Tanoto, 19, told ElShinta radio. "Only some 30 percent had managed to save themselves. They had lifejackets."
     </p>
     <p>
      "Many were still trapped in the ferry. I would say more than 50 percent of the passengers were still on board when the ship sank," he added.
     </p>

      Warships, fishing vessels and helicopters have braved continuing bad weather and rough seas to scour the waters off the north coast of Java since the "Senopati Nusantara" (Archipelago Commander) sank.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meteorologists have warned the bad weather and rough seas will continue for the next few days, with waves of two to four metres (six to 12 feet) high and strong winds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preliminary investigations showed bad weather was to blame for the accident, transport safety officials have said as they continue to collect data.
     </p>
     <p>
      The vessel was carrying 542 passengers and 57 crew when it sank. It was licensed to carry 850.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ferries are a crucial link between the archipelago nation's 17,000 islands and frequently carry more people than officially acknowledged.
