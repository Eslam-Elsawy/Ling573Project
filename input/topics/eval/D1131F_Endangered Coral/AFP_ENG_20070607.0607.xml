      Caribbean coral species essential to the region's reef ecosystems are at risk of extinction as a result of climate change, according to a new marine life study released Thursday.

      The report by Conservation International found 10 percent of the Caribbean's 62 spectacular reef-building corals -- one of the sea's most spectacular natural resources -- are under threat and candidates for "critically endangered" designations.

      "One of the Atlantic Ocean's most beautiful marine habitats no longer exists in many places because of dramatic increases in coral diseases, mostly caused by climate change and warmer waters," said Dr Michael Smith, director of the Caribbean Biodiversity Initiative at Conservation International.

      A gathering of 23 scientists in March 2007 analyzed data on tropical corals, seagrasses, mangroves and algae -- all fundamental components of healthy marine ecosystems.

      "Coral reefs support some of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. When the coral reefs disappear, so will many other species which rely on reefs for shelter, reproduction and foraging," said Dr Suzanne Livingstone, another marine biologist who contributed to the study.

      The scientists noted that in some well-managed, protected areas of the ocean, human impacts are reduced, allowing most corals to thrive.
