      The UN wildlife trade organisation imposed strict limits Wednesday on the global trade of pink and red coral, severely depleted by commercial exploitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      With a finished necklace retailing for up to 20,000 dollars (15,000 euros), red corals are among the world's most expensive wildlife commodities.
     </p>
     <p>
      But destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced worldwide catches by 90 percent in the past two decades, scientists say.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in these corals under some form of international control," said Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Until now most species of Corallium have been over-harvested as a result of a free-for-all situation."
     </p>
     <p>
      All 26 species in the Corallium genus will now be protected by the 171-nation Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which regulates the world trade in wildlife.

      But the ones most often exploited to make jewelry and art objects are red and pink coral, found throughout the world's tropical and temperate seas but harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and Western Pacific.
     </p>
     <p>
      Stocks off the coasts of Spain, Italy and France have already been commercially depleted, experts say.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several major retailers have supported the new restrictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We believe that coral harvesting as currently practiced is not sustainable and threatens marine ecosystems," said Fernanda Kellogg, senior vice president of Tiffany and Co.

      "We will not use this precious material in our jewelry until harvesting methods have been adopted that ensure the sustainability of coral reefs," she told Sea Web, an ocean conservation group that works with the international jeweler.
