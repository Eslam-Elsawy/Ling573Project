      East China's Shandong Province, a coastal region that suffers from a shortage of fresh water, will invest 3.6 billion yuan over the next four years to build 21 sea water desalination plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once built, the plants will turn out about 140 million cubic meters of fresh water every year, according to a government plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Qingdao, Yantai, Binzhou and a few other cities will benefit from the project, according to the plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like many Chinese regions, Shandong is suffering a worsening water shortage, but its 3,024 kilometers of coastline offers the solution of desalinating sea water.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shandong currently has 16 plants desalinating 32,000 cubic meters of sea water per day, 57 percent of the country's total.
     </p>
     <p>
      Besides sea water desalination, Shandong is seeking more fresh water through China's mammoth south-to-north water diversion program and the water diversion program of the Yellow River.
     </p>
     <p>
      The water resources in Shandong meet only one third of the province's demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the State Development and Reform Commission and some other state- level agencies, desalinated seawater is expected to contribute 16 to 24 percent of the water supply in coastal areas by 2010, with a daily processing capacity of up to 3 million cubic meters in 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of 600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages for domestic and industrial uses.
