      Telomeres -- nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes -- predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.

      Telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides. Shorter telomeres indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing, which varies according to the individual.

      British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western Scotland.

      The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.

      The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging cholesterol. Other volunteers received a dummy lookalike pill called a placebo.

      The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.

     <p>
      But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
     </p>
     <p>
      The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle-aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.
