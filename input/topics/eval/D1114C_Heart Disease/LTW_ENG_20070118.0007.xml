      HEART DISEASE

      Blood test may warn of complications.

      THE QUESTION When the heart is under stress, the blood appears to contain higher levels of a protein known as NT-proBNP. Might testing blood for this protein provide an advance warning of such events as heart attack and stroke?
     </p>
     <p>
      THIS STUDY involved 987 people, mostly men, with stable coronary artery disease who were given blood and urine tests, treadmill tests and echocardiograms and were monitored for nearly four years. During this time, 256 of the participants had a heart attack or stroke, developed heart failure or died. Of that group, 134 people had the highest protein level among all the participants and 23 had the lowest. The risk of a complication, especially heart failure, increased as the NT-proBNP level rose.

      WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE FINDINGS? People with coronary artery disease, which occurs when plaque builds up on arteries that supply blood to the heart, narrowing them and limiting blood flow. If the heart does not get enough blood, chest pain and heart attack can result and, over time, heart failure or arrhythmias can develop.
     </p>

      CAVEATS Whether the findings apply to women remains unclear. The study did not provide data comparing the test with existing tests. Blood analysis for the protein was funded by Roche Diagnostics, which provides testing services and products.

      The research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals. Nonetheless, conclusive evidence about a treatment's effectiveness is rarely found in a single study. Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician.
