      A judge has refused to dismiss murder charges against a man accused of causing a 2005 Los Angeles train crash that killed 11 people.

      The Los Angeles judge on Thursday denied a defense motion for Juan Manuel Alvarez and said the prosecution presented enough evidence to have the 29-year-old defendant stand trial.

      Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale. He fled the Jeep as a commuter train bore down.

      The resulting crash killed 11 people and injured about 180.

      Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty after charging him with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
