      Having recently won a murder conviction for Juan Manuel Alvarez in Glendale's 2005 Metrolink train disaster, prosecutors kicked off their arguments Monday trying to persuade jurors to sentence the Compton handyman to death.
     </p>
     <p>
      After watching gruesome photos and hearing emotional testimony from loved ones of the victims, some jurors were brought to tears as the prosecution pushed its case forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Life without parole is not justice for the 11 victims," Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham told the nine women and three men who will decide Alvarez's fate.
     </p>
     <p>
      As prosecutors continued, the jury could hear the sobs and wails of relatives of Leonardo Romero of Newport Beach. Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.

     <p>
      When prosecutors showed a photograph of Romero -- a former Marine and father of three, taken shortly after his death -- the family was overcome with emotion. One juror wiped tears streaming down her cheeks with a tissue and calmed herself by cooling her face with an Asian-style fan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez, 29, sitting dispassionately next to his attorneys, looked at the witnesses during their testimony and occasionally glanced at the photographs that prosecutors displayed on a large screen hanging from a wall in the courtroom.
     </p>
     <p>
      The jury appeared equally moved later when prosecutors presented their first two witnesses -- the mother and younger brother of James Tutino, 47, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was among the victims.
     </p>
     <p>
      Maureen Tutino narrated a slide show of her family's photographs that prosecutor John Monaghan presented to jurors, showing the central role James Tutino had occupied in the lives of his loved ones and the void his death had created.
     </p>
     <p>
      "He was kind of the sunshine of our life," said an emotionally wrought Maureen Tutino, "and we miss that."
     </p>
     <p>
      Tutino said one of James' sons, Nick, will be sworn in as a sheriff's deputy July 17 and will be given his father's badge number.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tony Tutino, who followed his brother's footsteps into law enforcement, recounted the draining ordeal of learning of James' death -- and then the most difficult part: never being "able to go say goodbye to my brother."
     </p>
     <p>
      "Because of the injuries he suffered, I had to say my goodbyes through a coffin, and that's the most difficult thing for me. I'll regret that for the rest of my life."
     </p>
     <p>
      Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life. The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death for Alvarez until at least late next week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson. The jury also found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, which makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      The train derailment also injured 180 people.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prosecutors want the jury to recommend that Alvarez be executed instead of spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Life without parole is not an adequate, appropriate punishment," Brougham told jurors. "The defendant deserves the greater punishment."
     </p>
     <p>
      In her closing argument, Brougham presented profiles of each of the 11 people who died, saying family members and friends would attest to the loss and tragedy caused by their deaths.
     </p>
     <p>
      "You can only begin to imagine the damage that this man has caused," Brougham said of the victims. "Each was a unique individual with a future, with a family, with hopes, with dreams."
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez's attorneys deferred their argument until they begin presenting the defense case, possibly later this week.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to Alvarez family members, defense attorneys are expected to elicit testimony from psychiatrists in an attempt to portray the convicted killer in the sympathetic light of a troubled man who was abused as a child by his father and uncle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Possibly preparing for that, prosecutors reminded jurors that Alvarez's brother and sister had also been abused as children, but that they, like most children who have been abused, did not wind up as mass murderers.
     </p>
     <p>
      "He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning," Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez's testimony. "It's not an accident that these people were murdered by him."
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez, according to Brougham, had acted as a man bent on destruction with no sense of conscience about the havoc he would cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brougham also reminded jurors of testimony that while in jail, Alvarez had dealt drugs, intimidated prisoners and engaged in other behavior inconsistent with a person truly sorry for his actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      "That is not a remorseful, regretful person," she said. "Every time the defense asks you for mercy, think of his conduct in jail. Think of the real Juan Alvarez."
