      For the engineer of Metrolink 100, the horror of Jan. 26, 2005, came seconds after he noticed an odd reflection on the tracks, about a quarter mile dead ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      As his train with three passenger cars zoomed straight for the reflection at nearly 80 mph, he soon realized it was coming from an SUV straddling the tracks.
     </p>
     <p>
      "He ran down the aisle and told people to 'Hold on! Hold on!"' Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan told jurors Monday in opening remarks at the trial for the Metrolink train crash in Glendale, in which 11 passengers and crew died. About 180 other people were injured.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prosecutors portrayed Juan Manuel Alvarez, the man accused of murder, as an egomaniac meth user who wanted to kill people as a way to get attention from his estranged wife.
     </p>
     <p>
      Playing a slide show featuring photos of the victims when they were alive, followed by shots of their bodies in the wreckage, Los Angeles County prosecutors said there is no doubt that Alvarez is guilty of murder for dousing his SUV with gasoline, leaving it on railroad tracks in Glendale and watching the carnage unfold.
     </p>
     <p>
      "On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people," Monaghan said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The defense argued that Alvarez's only intent that morning was to kill himself. While he's responsible for setting off a "perfect storm" of escalating events that resulted in the death of 11 people, that doesn't make him a murderer, said Thomas Kielty, Alvarez's defense lawyer.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Juan Alvarez was looking for a place to light himself on fire," said Kielty about the reason Alvarez initially drove his Jeep south, well past the legal traffic barrier at the train crossing at Chevy Chase Drive, between Los Angeles and Glendale.
     </p>
     <p>
      He then decided that getting hit by a train would be a more efficient way to kill himself, his attorney said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself," Kielty said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez, 29, with shorter hair and a goatee, wore a cream-color suit at the opening of his trial. He is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson and train wrecking, along with special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders and train wrecking stemming from the crash.
     </p>
     <p>
      About 6 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train 100, heading southbound, smashed into Alvarez's SUV before derailing and hitting two more trains, including the northbound Metrolink 901.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Don't let me burn! don't let me burn!" Monaghan said passengers on board the trains screamed in the fiery aftermath.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The evidence will clearly show beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alvarez is the individual that parked a jeep that had been doused with gasoline on the southbound tracks."
     </p>
     <p>
      Alvarez's methamphetamine use was so bad and he was so delusional that he thought the CIA was following him and that his wife had a slew of lovers, including one who secretly slept with the couple in their bed, prompting Alvarez to sleep with a knife, Kielty said.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a series of incidents and suicide or "pretend-suicide" attempts, as the prosecutors called them -- such as when Alvarez inflicted wounds on himself or took pills -- his wife kicked him out of their home. She got a restraining order in late 2004 to keep him away from her, their children, as well as his mother and brother, whom Alvarez allegedly threatened to kill.
     </p>
     <p>
      The defense contends that after hearing the voices of his estranged wife and "her lover" calling him stupid, coming from the back seat of his dark-green Jeep Cherokee, Alvarez, who was on his way to work at about 5:30 a.m., decided to kill himself. He filled up two water bottles with gasoline and went to look for a place to light himself on fire.
     </p>
     <p>
      But prosecutors said they believe the evidence will show that Alvarez didn't intend to kill himself, just others.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Mr. Alvarez used Metrolink 100 as a match to light his vehicle on fire," Monaghan said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.
     </p>
     <p>
      "He could have simply walked in front of that train," Brogham said. "He didn't just go jump off a bridge. He did not go drive his vehicle off a mountain."
     </p>
     <p>
      The defense claims that Alvarez changed his mind about the suicide and tried unsuccessfully to back the jeep off the tracks, but the vehicle was stuck.
     </p>
     <p>
      For Henry Romero, whose uncle Leonardo Romero was killed in the crash, there's nothing the defense can say to convince him of Alvarez's innocence.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Blatant murder is what I think it is," Romero said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The family is involved in a lawsuit against the Metrolink, saying that the push method used to propel the Metrolink 100 -- where the engine is behind the passenger cars -- was unsafe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Metrolink is fighting the suit on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      And in 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be impractical and expensive.
