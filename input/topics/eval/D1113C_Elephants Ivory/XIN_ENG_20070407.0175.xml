      Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority officials is preparing plans on how to deal with the proposal to ban international trade in ivory, the official New Ziana reported on Saturday.

      The authority director general Morris Mutsambiwa said they have already discussed responses to the proposal by Kenya and Mali to ban international trade in ivory.

      Mutsambiwa said recommendations of the SADC countries would be taken to the African Range of States a few weeks before the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conference to be held in June this year so that the continent would take a common position to the international conference.

      He said Zimbabwe did not want a repeat of the last CITES meeting when some African countries disowned the common position that had been agreed on.

      Kenya and Mali are proposing an international ban on trade in ivory arguing that it was causing poaching of its elephants.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Kenyan government has prepared a 62-page document that it will take to CITES justifying its proposals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, Zimbabwe is arguing that instead of banning the trade, countries should put in place adequate measures to prevent poaching of wildlife as it has done.
     </p>
     <p>
      Zimbabwe has invested heavily in protecting its wildlife resulting in the country becoming a prime tourist destination.
     </p>
     <p>
      "If international trade is killed, it will destroy jobs for traders and other downstream industries," said Mutsambiwa.
     </p>
     <p>
      The United States and Britain are using some African countries to settle their political differences with Zimbabwe through sponsoring them to take positions and decisions that adversely affect the country's economy, Mutsambiwa added.
