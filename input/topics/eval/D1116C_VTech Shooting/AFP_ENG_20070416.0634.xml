      The Federal Bureau of Investigation said there was no sign the killing of at least 30 people at a US university on Monday was the result of terrorism.

      "There is no indication that this is an act of terrorism," FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said in a statement.

      "However, every avenue will be investigated."

      A gunman opened fire on classrooms at Virginia Tech University on Monday morning, killing at least 30 people before turning his gun on himself in the bloodiest school shooting in US history.

      Panic erupted on the campus as shots and screams first echoed in a Virginia Tech University dormitory where students were preparing for morning classes, followed two hours later by a massacre in an engineering building.

      Police could not confirm whether the same gunman was responsible for both incidents. The earlier shooting in the dormitory left a man and a woman dead on the Blacksburg, Virginia campus.

      University police and Virginia state police were leading the investigation into the shooting spree, and the FBI was serving in an "assistance role only," Kolko said.
