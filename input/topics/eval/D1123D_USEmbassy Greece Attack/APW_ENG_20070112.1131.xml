      The United States said Friday it was unaware of any international involvement in a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Greece, but the investigation was in its early stages.

      State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said U.S. and Greek authorities were cooperating "to determine who's responsible for it and deal with them appropriately within the judicial system."

      Greek authorities have said the attack probably was carried out by a domestic terror group.

      When asked about that possibility, McCormack said: "We all know from history that there are a number of these anarchist groups in Greece, and that they are sometimes violent. I can't tell you if one of those is responsible for this particular attack."

      A small anti-tank missile pierced the building above the front entrance early Friday morning. McCormack said nobody was injured, and damage was minimal.

      Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis has visited U.S. Ambassador Charles Ries, McCormack said, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called the ambassador for a briefing.

      The embassy is set back 65 feet from the street. McCormack said the safety of U.S. embassies is "something that we take seriously."
