      An anti-tank shell was fired at the U.S. embassy early Friday, striking the front of the building but causing no injuries. A senior police official said the blast was an act of terrorism, raising fears of a resurgence of far-left Greek militant groups.
     </p>
     <p>
      Public Order Minister Vyron Polydoras said Greece "strongly condemns" the attack on the heavily guarded building. "We believe it is a symbolic act," he said. "It is an attempt to disrupt our country's international relations."
     </p>
     <p>
      Police cordoned off streets around the building after the explosion shortly before 6 a.m (0400 GMT). The shell struck the third floor -- narrowly missing the embassy emblem -- and smashed glass in nearby buildings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investigators were examining what they believed was the device used to fire the shell from a construction site near the embassy.
     </p>
     <p>
      "This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from," Attica Police Chief Asimakis Golfis said. "There was a shell that exploded in the toilets of the building ... It was fired from street level."
     </p>
     <p>
      Embassy officials confirmed that an explosion had taken place and said that no one had been injured. U.S. ambassador Charles Ries said the damage was "not extensive."
     </p>
     <p>
      "There can be no justification for such a senseless act of violence. ... The embassy was occupied at the time (but) nobody was hurt," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ries said there had been no warning of the attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We're treating it as a very serious attack. We will determine what it is when we know (more)," he said.
     </p>

      Greece's public order minister said police were examining the authenticity of phone calls claiming responsibility on behalf of a militant left-wing group.
     </p>
     <p>
      "There are one or two telephone calls, from unknown callers, who claimed that the Revolutionary Struggle assumes responsibility," Polydoras said.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said the calls were made to a private security company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility for a May 2006 bomb attack on Culture Minister Giorgos Voulgarakis, in which nobody was injured.
     </p>
     <p>
      Authorities were searching apartment buildings near the U.S. Embassy and a nearby hospital for evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      "At 5:58 a.m. an explosion was caused by a self-propelling shell, causing minor damage at the front of the building. ... The Greek Police are working closely with the embassy authorities," a police statement said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited the embassy after the blast.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I came here to express the solidarity of the Greek people following this deplorable action," she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Such actions in the past have had a very heavy cost for the country -- moral, financial and for the international standing of the country. The Greek government is determined to undertake every effort to not allow such phenomena to be repeated in the future."
     </p>
     <p>
      A U.S. State Department spokesman confirmed that the attack caused no injuries.
     </p>
     <p>
      "There are no injuries or casualties of any kind," Kurtis Cooper said. "Police have responded. As a result the embassy will be closed today, Friday."
     </p>
     <p>
      Traffic came to a standstill for more than three hours across parts of central Athens, as police and emergency services scrambled to the embassy building, which is a frequent destination for protest groups.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I heard a loud bang. I didn't realize what was going on," said Giorgos Yiannoulis, who runs a kiosk near the embassy.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was the first major attack against a U.S. target in more than a decade, following the arrest of members of Greece's far-left November 17 terrorist group. The group was blamed for killing 23 people -- including U.S., British and Turkish officials -- and dozens of bomb attacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2003, a special court gave multiple life sentences to November 17's leader, chief assassin and three other members. Lesser sentences were given to 10 others.
     </p>
     <p>
      November 17 carried out a similar rocket attack against the U.S. embassy in 1996, causing minor damage and no injuries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several obscure militant groups have appeared since the November 17 members were arrested.
     </p>
     <p>
      Radical groups Revolutionary Struggle and Popular Revolutionary Action were blamed for the bombings of three government ministries in 2005.
