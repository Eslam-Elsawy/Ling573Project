      The United States heaped praise on Greek authorities for their response Friday to a rocket attack on the US embassy in Athens, a city it once considered a relatively soft target for violent extremists.

      The early morning attack with a rocket-propelled grenade caused no casualties and only minor damage to the embassy and was claimed by a far-left group called Revolutionary Struggle.

      While condemning the attack, US State Department spokesmen hailed the response from Green government and law enforcement officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We've been getting great cooperation from Greek authorities," Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
     </p>
     <p>
      We "appreciate very much the extraordinarily positive and supportive response that we got from the Greek government in addition to the Greek law enforcement activity associated with this," added his deputy, Tom Casey said.
     </p>
     <p>
      They said Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis visited Ambassador Charles Ries at the embassy within hours of the attack, as did the government's minister for public order.
     </p>
     <p>
      US officials said they were unaware of any international links to the attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We think it's an isolated incident," said White House spokesman Tony Snow.
     </p>
     <p>
      But Casey said the attack was still viewed as serious and that forensic experts from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation were going to Athens to help with the probe.
     </p>
     <p>
      "I don't know any other word to call it other than terrorism, but the main point is this violent attack against our diplomatic facility is something obviouly that we want to see fully investigated and we want to see the perpetrators brought to jsutice," he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      US institutions, banks and companies in Greece were frequently targeted by militant groups in past decades, including the murder of a CIA station chief in Athens in 1975 by the far-left November 17 group.
     </p>
     <p>
      While security has been seen to improve significantly since November 17 was broken up in 2002, US officials were outspoken about their concerns over security preparations for the 2004 Athens Olympics and pressed for a big international role in protecting the games from possible terrorist attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      Friday's incident was viewed as one of the most serious since November 17 was dismantled and raised fears of a resurgence of extremist violence in Greece.
