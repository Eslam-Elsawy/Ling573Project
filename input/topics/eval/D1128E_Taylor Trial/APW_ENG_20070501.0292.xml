      Judges have postponed testimony from witnesses at the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, due to start next month, to give defense attorneys more time to prepare.
     </p>
     <p>
      An April 25 ruling that was posted on the Special Court for Sierra Leone's Web site this week said Taylor's trial will begin as planned on June 4 but will be adjourned until June 25 after prosecutors deliver their opening statement.

      Taylor is accused of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone while he was leader of neighboring West African state Liberia.

      Lead defense lawyer Karim Khan had asked for the trial to be postponed because consultations with his client were interrupted. Khan stopped meeting Taylor after authorities at the detention block installed video surveillance cameras in the room where the lawyers and Taylor discussed the case.

      "Mr. Taylor, through no fault of his own, has lost preparation time owing to the suspension of client-attorney consultations from 5-22 March 2007," said the ruling by the three-judge panel. "It would be in the interests of a fair trial for him to be compensated for preparation time lost during that period."
     </p>
     <p>
      Defense attorneys are considering appealing, arguing that they still do not have enough time to prepare their case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to allegations that he armed and trained rebels responsible for a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in Sierra Leone's 10-year civil war. If convicted he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

      Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging the trial in Sierra Leone, where the Special Court usually sits, could trigger fresh unrest.

      The case, being heard in a courtroom rented from the International Criminal Court, is expected to last about 18 months.
