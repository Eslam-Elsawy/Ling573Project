      Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor, on trial at a UN-backed court in The Hague for alleged war crimes, demanded Friday more time to construct his defence.

      The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the International Criminal Court (ICC), has already been delayed once from April 2 until June 4 after a similar request, and this time the judge said no.

      "I need more time to prepare," Taylor's British lawyer Karim Khan had told the hearing which Taylor himself did not attend because of a bad back. "The prosecution had five years, we had less than five months," she protested.

      Taylor was moved out of Freetown and to the premises in The Hague to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.

      Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left some 400,000 people dead.

      He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights and is specifically accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered, enslaved and mutilated civilians.
