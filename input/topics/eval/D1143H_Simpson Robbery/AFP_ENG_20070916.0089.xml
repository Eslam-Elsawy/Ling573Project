      OJ Simpson, the ex-American footballer at the center of a notorious murder trial in the 1990s, has been arrested in connection with an armed robbery in Las Vegas, US television reported Sunday.

      Police arrested him in a continuing investigation over an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia at a casino hotel room, Las Vegas police cited on news networks said.

      Simpson had been interrogated late Thursday following reports of a robbery from a guest's room at the Palace Station casino in which he is alleged to have played a part, police Captain James Dillon told reporters Friday.

      Simpson was released without charge last week after questioning, but taken into custody again Sunday, according to reports.

      Media said Sunday another man, Walter Alexander, was arrested in the case and charged with armed robbery, but CNN news reported that according to witnesses Simpson himself did not possess a gun.

      The alleged stolen items included "sports-related products" according to authorities. The alleged victim was identified by celebrity news website TMZ.com, as Alfred Beardsley, a collector of sports memorabilia.

      Beardsley told the website that Simpson and a group of men entered his room pretending to be customers. Two men with Simpson pulled guns during the robbery, Beardsley said.

      Simpson, one of the most famous American football players of his generation during the 1970s, was the prime suspect in the 1994 murders of his estranged wife Nicole Brown-Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.

      Simpson, who has always denied the killings, was acquitted of them after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in 1995, a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across America.

      The former sports star was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the victims' families totaling 33.5 million dollars.
