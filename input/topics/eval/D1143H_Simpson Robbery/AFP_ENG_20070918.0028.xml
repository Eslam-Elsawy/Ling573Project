      Former American football star O.J. Simpson has been charged with eight offences, including kidnapping and armed robbery, court documents showed Tuesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simpson, an iconic sports star who was dramatically acquitted of brutally murdering his ex-wife and her friend 12 years ago, is to appear in court in Las Vegas on Wednesday for an arraignment hearing.

      The charges against Simpson and three other men were detailed in a criminal complaint filed by Nevada prosecutors in Clark County on Tuesday, following the fallen icon's arrest on Sunday in connection with an alleged armed robbery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simpson and the men have been charged with seven felony offences: conspiracy to commit conspiracy to commit first degree kidnapping with use of a deadly burglary with a deadly robbery with a deadly assault with a deadly weapon and coercion with a deadly weapon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The four men have also been charged with the misdemeanor offence of conspiracy to commit a crime.
     </p>
     <p>
      If convicted on the most serious charges Simpson would face several years, possibly decades, in prison.
     </p>
     <p>
      The charges stem from an incident at the Palace Station casino on Thursday, when a gang of gun-toting men that included Simpson is reported to have stormed into a hotel room and snatched sporting memorabilia from two dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simpson is currently behind bars in Las Vegas in connection with the alleged robbery. In interviews with US media prior to his arrest he denied robbery, saying he was only recovering items that had been illegally stolen from him.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the most famous American football players of his generation during the 1970s, Simpson was the prime suspect in the 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simpson, who has always vehemently denied the killings, was acquitted of them after a racially charged Los Angeles trial in 1995, a verdict that was greeted with widespread outrage across America.
     </p>
     <p>
      Simpson was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages to the victims' families totaling 33.5 million dollars.
