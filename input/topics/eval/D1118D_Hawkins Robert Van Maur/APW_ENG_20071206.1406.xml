      The teenage gunman who went on a shooting rampage in an Omaha department store, killing eight people, may have smuggled an assault rifle into the mall underneath clothing, police said Thursday.

      Police Chief Thomas Warren said the young man "appeared to be concealing something balled up in a hooded sweat shirt" he was carrying, according to a surveillance video.

      The teen entered the store Wednesday using an elevator, and moments later, fired the gun into the Westroads Mall's Von Maur department store. People huddled in dressing rooms and barricaded themselves in offices as 19-year-old Robert A. Hawkins sprayed the floor with bullets.

      Six store employees and two customers were killed. When the shooting was over, Hawkins shot himself.

      The mall was closed Thursday as authorities continued to investigate what may have motivated the teen to go on the shooting spree. It was Nebraska's deadliest since January 1958, when Charles Starkweather killed 10 people in Nebraska and another person in Wyoming.

      "We will not accept this evil action to occur in our community," Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey said at a news conference.

      Police believe Hawkins stole the assault rifle, an AK-47, from his stepfather's home, Warren said. Hawkins either was kicked out or left home some time ago, and moved in with Debora Maruca-Kovac and her husband, whose sons were friends with him, Maruca-Kovac said.

      Attempts to reach Hawkins' biological parents on Thursday by The Associated Press were unsuccessful. A man who answered at a phone number listed for Hawkins' father, Ronald Hawkins, said it was a wrong number. Nobody answered the door at the home of Maribel Rodriguez of Bellevue on Thursday. Court records list her as Hawkins' mother.

      Hawkins was described by many as having a troubled past. He recently split with his girlfriend and been fired from McDonald's. He also had a criminal record and had left or been kicked out of his parents' house.

      He dropped out of Papillion-La Vista High School as a senior in March 2006, principal James Glover said Thursday. While he was not a loner, he had a very small group of friends and was not involved in extracurricular activities, Glover said.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It was never a situation where he was out of the loop because people were picking on him," Glover said.
     </p>
     <p>
      About an hour before the shooting, Hawkins called her and told her he had written a suicide note, Maruca-Kovac said. In the note, which was turned over to authorities, Hawkins wrote that he was "sorry for everything" and would not be a burden on his family anymore. More ominously, he wrote, "Now I'll be famous."
     </p>
     <p>
      "I was fearful that he was going to try to commit suicide but I had no idea that he would involve so many other families," she told CBS' "The Early Show," Thursday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Records in Sarpy and Washington counties showed Hawkins had a felony drug conviction and several misdemeanor cases filed against him, including an arrest 11 days before the shooting for having alcohol as a minor. He was due in court in two weeks.

      When the shots began, the store descended into chaos.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mickey Vickroy, who worked in the store's third-floor service department, said she heard shots and went with coworkers and customers into a back closet, emerging about a half-hour later when police shouted to come out with their hands up. As police led them to another part of the mall for safety, they saw the victims.

      "We saw the bodies and we saw the blood," she said.

      Omaha attorney Jeff Schaffart, 34, was shopping with his wife and, after fleeing, realized he had been hit by two bullets, one in the upper arm and another grazing his left pinkie finger.

      While hiding in a restroom, Schaffart said, he used his necktie as a tourniquet for his arm wound and put napkins on his finger to stop the bleeding. He was later treated and released at a hospital.

      The customers killed were Gary Scharf, 48 of Lincoln and John McDonald, 65, of Council Bluffs, Iowa. The employees killed were Angie Schuster, 36, of Maggie Webb, Janet Jorgensen, 66 of Diane Trent, 53 of Gary Joy, 56 of and Beverly Flynn, 47, of Omaha, police said.

      Nebraska Medical Center spokeswoman Andrea McMaster said the hospital had three victims from the mall shooting, including Fred Wilson, 61, who was in critical condition early Thursday with a bullet wound to his chest.

      Micky Oldham, 65, was in stable condition at Creighton University Medical Center. Oldham, who was shot once in the abdomen and once in the back, underwent surgery Wednesday to repair injuries, Dr. Leon Sykes said.

      The sprawling, three-level mall has more than 135 stores and restaurants. It gets 14.5 million visitors every year, according to its Web site.

      It was the second mass shooting at a mall this year. In February, nine people were shot, five of them fatally, at Trolley Square mall in Salt Lake City. The gunman, 18-year-old Bosnian immigrant Sulejman Talovic, was shot and killed by police.
