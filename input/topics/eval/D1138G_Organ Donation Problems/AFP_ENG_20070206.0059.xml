      The Philippine government is to begin consulting on guidelines for human organ donations to foreigners, a government official said Tuesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      At present there are no specific rules on organ donation to foreigners.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the trade in human organs, especially kidneys, takes place on the black market.
     </p>

      Health Undersecretary Jade Del Mundo said organ donation was big business in the Philippines, especially among the poor, who sell their kidneys.
     </p>
     <p>
      A study conducted recently by the University of the Philippines found that in one slum area in Manila, there were 3,000 men and women who had sold one of their kidneys for 70,000-120,000 pesos (1,440-2,469 dollars).

      Starting this weekend, the government will begin a series of consultations with private and public health sector leaders on how to regulate organ donation in the "face of rampant, under-the-table traffic in human organs," Del Mundo said.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said the government was looking at ways of regulating the process by which kidneys were obtained.
     </p>
     <p>
      A report in a Japanese newspaper recently said that if the system of organ donation were regulated, the Philippines could see a rush of foreign patients, including from Japan, where 10,000 people are currently awaiting kidney transplants.
