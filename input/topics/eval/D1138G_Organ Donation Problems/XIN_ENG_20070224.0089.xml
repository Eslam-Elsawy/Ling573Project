      Zimbabwe could soon revive its human organ donation program in a bid to keep up with global health technological developments, the official New Ziana reported on Saturday.

      Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Edwin Muguti said strong regulatory measures would be put in place to ensure the success of the program and shield it from abuse.

      Funding, which hindered the previous attempt to set up the program some 10 years ago, would also be sourced, he said.

      The government is working on resuscitating the human organ donation program and, because of its international scrutiny, Zimbabwe will craft strong legislative laws to guard it from abuse, Muguti said.

      He said the program, which registered some meaningful success in the early 1990s, would help address some health issues and improve service delivery.

      Currently, patients that require human organ donations have to go abroad as Zimbabwe does not have adequate and proper resources such as machines and funds to conduct the operations.
