      CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.

      Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft currently in PNG on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's remote north.

      The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map, leaving hundreds people dead or missing.

      The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area.

      Many of the villagers are believed to have died instantly as the deadly wall of water struck without warning, sending their homes crashing into the raging torrent.

      Downer said the federal government stood ready to consider further requests for assistance from the PNG government.
