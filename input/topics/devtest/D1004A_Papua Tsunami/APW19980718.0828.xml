     The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean. ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the Papua New Guinean government. Among the dead are scores of schoolchildren. Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another. ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure may increase as more bodies are found.''
