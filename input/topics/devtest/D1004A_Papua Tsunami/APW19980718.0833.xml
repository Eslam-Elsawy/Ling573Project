     Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on beaches. Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000 people. Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if requested by the Papua New Guinean government. Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths. ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
