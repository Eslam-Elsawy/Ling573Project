     Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing. ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the mangroves.'' Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people and schoolchildren. ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all dead.'' Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed. At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead, while Malol village had 40 dead and Sissano 41. Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later this afternoon to assess the situation. Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter. Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern tip of Australia. MORE
