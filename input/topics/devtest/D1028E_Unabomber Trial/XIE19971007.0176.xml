      WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Jury selection for the trial of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in Sacramento, California, with an unprecedented number of nearly 600 prospective jurors to be interviewed.

      It is expected that several hundred prospects may be eliminated quickly because the trial and selection process could cause the trial to last for six months, including the jury courtroom selection, which is scheduled to begin November 12.

      Attorneys are hopeful they can impanel 12 impartial jurors and six alternates to decide the fate of Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former college math instructor, who was arrested at a remote Montana cabin last year, United Press International reported.

      He is charged in Sacramento with placing or mailing four bombs that killed computer store owner Hugh Scrutton in 1985 and timber lobbyist Gilbert Murray in 1995, and with injuring two scientists in the San Francisco Bay area and in Connecticut in 1993.

      Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a separate case in New Jersey.

      U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell Jr. has ordered that jurors' identities in the Sacramento trial be kept secret, but said they won't be sequestered.
