      WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Unabomber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded innocent today via video to charges he sent the mail bomb killing an advertising executive exactly two years ago.

      Kaczynski's plea from California was made through a live hookup to the federal courthouse in Newark, New jersey, where Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise presided in a courtroom, The Associated Press reported.

      Among those present was Susan Mosser, whose 50-year-old husband, Thomas, was killed when he opened a package containing a bomb on December 10, 1994, in his northern New Jersey home.

      In Sacramento, California, where Kaczynski has been jailed since early summer, the U.S. Marshals Service moved Kaczynski to the county public defender's office for the cross-country arraignment.

      Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.

      Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths.

      Debevoise also heard arguments on a defense request to transfer the New Jersey case to Sacramento, where a November trial date has been set. Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.

      Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln, Montana, and is being held without bail.

      Federal authorities believe he used bombs to kill three people and injure 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
