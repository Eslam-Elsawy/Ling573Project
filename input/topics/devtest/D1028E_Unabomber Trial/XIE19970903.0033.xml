      WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The judge in the trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of defense requests for revisions in jury selection.

      In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a court document service today, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. in Sacramento, California, said defense lawyers Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke had failed to prove the necessity of expanding the jury pool beyond the list of registered voters, media reports said.

      Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets. The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.

      The former college math instructor is charged separately in New Jersey in connection with a fifth bombing.

      Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges. If convicted, he could receive the death penalty.

      The defense had asked that lists of licensed drivers, as well as lists of registered voters, be used to broaden the pool of ury.

      Burrell said the request had to be rejected because the defense had failed to show that using the voter rolls the impact of pretrial news coverage.
