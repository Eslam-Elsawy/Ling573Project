      WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for UNABOMber suspect Theodore Kaczynski are asking for special measures to find northern California jurors who aren't biased against him by news coverage.

      Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year. The UNABOMber was so named because his early targets were universities and airlines.

      Attorneys Quin Denvir and Judy Clarke have asked that prospective jurors for the November 12 trial in Sacramento, California, be picked from within the Eastern District, which includes Sacramento and 22 other counties, according to news reports.

      Their 1,600-page motion also asks the pool to be taken from licensed drivers rather than voter registration lists typically used in federal trials.

      Denvir and Clarke want prospective jurors to complete detailed questionnaires about their knowledge of the case and their feelings about the death penalty, which the government is seeking against Kaczynski.

      The attorneys say the 17-year case has prompted more news coverage than any other in history, including 341 New York Times articles between June 1993 and May 1997.

      Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of 16 bombings, which killed two men and wounded two others. He is charged with a third death in New Jersey.

      Prosecutors say they expect to take up to four weeks to present evidence showing that Kaczynski is the UNABOMber.
