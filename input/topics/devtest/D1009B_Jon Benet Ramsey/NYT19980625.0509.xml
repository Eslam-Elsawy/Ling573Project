     PARENTS OF JONBENET RAMSEY END 3 DAYS OF QUESTIONING
    </headline>

     <p>
      BOULDER, Colo. _ With the threat looming of a grand jury inquest into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the parents of the murdered beauty princess Thursday completed three days of questioning by prosecutors here, breaking their 16 months of official silence.
     </p>
     <p>
      John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' Hunter said after questioning ended Thursday afternoon. ``Questioning was not restricted in content or length. The Ramseys have agreed to continue to cooperate and to provide certain documents.''
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old brother. The Ramseys and their two children were the only people known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder, 18 months ago.

      Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      A new grand jury was impaneled here two months ago. Early this month, Boulder police spent two days detailing the case to Hunter. At the end of the closed-door sessions, Hunter indicated that he would decide whether or not to call a grand jury by early July. On Thursday, he said: ``I do not know when I will make this decision.''
     </p>
     <p>
      On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case. Earlier this month, Beckner, who has directed the murder investigation since October, said that there were ``30 reasons'' why a grand jury investigation was necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I have an idea who did it,'' he continued, conceding: ``It's certainly a circumstantial case.''
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, Beckner said he was ``excited'' about new evidence. According to news reports, this new evidence came from laboratory tests on clothes the parents wore the night of the murder. In addition, tests recently confirmed that a felt pen found in the Ramsey house was used to write the ransom note. Boulder police already had said that the ransom note was written on a pad found in the house.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the police chief and district attorney both have said that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they have not formally named any suspects.
     </p>
     <p>
      So far, the investigation has cost this small city $1 million in additional police and prosecution expenses. In an accounting, Boulder police said that, as of early June, they had interviewed 590 people, investigated 122 suspects and taken 1,058 pieces of evidence. The public had come forward with 700 telephone tips and 3,400 letters.
     </p>
     <p>
      By talking to prosecutors now, the Ramseys may be trying to head off grand jury appearances later this summer. When talking with prosecutors, the Ramseys are not under oath, can refuse to answer questions, can benefit from considerable advice from their defense attorneys, and can avoid running a media gauntlet to enter a courthouse. These conditions do not generally apply in a grand jury setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``You only use a grand jury to compel evidence: testimony or documents,'' said Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who is now a defense attorney. ``They may prefer to testify in a relaxed setting, not under oath. They knew of Hunter's deadline to decide on a grand jury. This is a game of chicken.''

      While JonBenet is now a household name from here to Finland, not everyone in this quiet college town is enamored of the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last month, two men rented the Ramsey family's Tudor-style mansion, which had remained empty since the murder. To discourage gawkers, the men promptly planted three large spruce trees to block the street view.

      Also last month, John Eller, the first police commander of the JonBenet investigation, was in Key West, Fla., trying unsuccessfully be hired as police chief of that town, 2,000 miles from here.
     </p>
     <p>
      Joseph Bellipanni, the Boulder District Court chief judge who was expected to preside over a JonBenet grand jury, resigned last month, after 15 years on the job. He is moving to Cairo to take a U.S.-government-funded job as an adviser to reform Egypt's court system. His move to the far side of the globe prompted The Denver Post to headline: ``Trading Ramseys for Ramses.''
