    Family's reason for cooperation spurs speculation By Craig Schneider c. 1998 Cox News Service

      ATLANTA -- When John and Patsy Ramsey hired lawyers after their daughter, JonBenet, was killed and then distanced themselves from police, it didn't sit right with Nancy Gordon.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``The fact that they did not work with police from the beginning led me and my family to place a cloud of suspicion over the family,'' said Gordon, an Acworth schoolteacher and mother of three.
     </p>
     <p>
      So when the Ramseys had three days of interviews last week with investigators from the district attorney's office, Gordon wondered, ``Why the wait? What has changed? If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to hide.''
     </p>
     <p>
      But Susan Gordy of Atlanta said the Ramseys' stated reason for waiting makes sense. The Ramseys say they broke off talks with the police 14 months ago because they felt the police were out to get them, said their attorney Hal Haddon. They waited for the case to be handed over this month to the district attorney, whom they trusted more, he added.

      ``I don't think I'd be talking either,'' said Gordy. ``Everybody kind of jumped on them in the beginning.''

      The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury. After conducting full-day sessions of videotaped interviews Tuesday through Thursday, Hunter said he is leaning toward convening a grand jury. Recent developments, he said, might delay his decision beyond his original early July estimate.

      ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' said Hunter, who declined to discuss the specifics of the conversations held in Colorado, except to say the family handed over some important documents. Their 11-year-old son, Burke, also was interviewed over three days in Atlanta, where the family now resides.

      Burke was in the family's Boulder home when 6-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996. While his parents are among those under ``an umbrella of suspicion,'' police say the boy is not a suspect.

      Legal experts say the interviews allowed the family and authorities to feel out each other. Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said he also sees some posturing for the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``The Ramseys can say, `The cops were incompetent, so much so that we didn't want to talk to them. As soon as the case went to the district attorney, we did go in,''' said Cohen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Haddon, the Ramsey attorney, said the family's communication with the district attorney actually began over a year ago and included handing over records regarding medical, phone, bank and business matters. John and Patsy Ramsey were interviewed simultaneously in separate rooms last week, each accompanied by an attorney and a private investigator, and no restrictions were placed on the questioning. The only condition demanded by the Ramseys was that ``police not be in the room,'' said Suzanne Laurion, a district attorney spokeswoman.

      The interviews can have benefits for both the investigators and the Ramseys, said Christopher Mueller, a law professor at the University of Colorado. The investigators can probe the family members' knowledge and look for any important inconsistencies in their stories. A family member can, if innocent, offer more tidbits to help the probe and, if guilty, persuasively lie to prevent a prosecution, he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``They may be they may be trying to help,'' Mueller said.
