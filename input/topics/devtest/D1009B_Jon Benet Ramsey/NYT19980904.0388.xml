    Two special prosecutors appointed to Ramsey case By Joshua B. Good c. 1998 Cox News Service

      The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled the Ramsey case.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Given all the recent questions ... public confidence demanded absolutely that we have the most experienced prosecutor we could get,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Levin and Morrissey together have 32 years of experience prosecuting homicide cases. They work in Colorado counties outside of Hunter's jurisdiction, but will answer to Hunter on the Ramsey case. The grand jury will begin hearing evidence later this month, Laurion said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last month, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer refused to appoint a prosecutor who could have taken the case over from Hunter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Romer made his decision after a police detective who investigated the slaying of the 6-year-old girl resigned and claimed Hunter bungled the Ramsey case.
     </p>
     <p>
      Romer also considered a Ramsey family friend's claim that Hunter's friendship with lawyers representing John and Patsy Ramsey clouded his judgment on the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      The friend, Fleet White, criticized the Ramseys, saying their refusal to cooperate with detectives hurt the investigation of their daughter's death. The Ramseys remain under suspicion in the homicide.
     </p>
     <p>
      White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
