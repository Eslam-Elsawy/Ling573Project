     JONBENET RAMSEY CASE MOVES AT `INCREDIBLY SLOW' PACE
    </headline>
    (ATTN: Colo., Ga.) (mk) By JAMES BROOKE c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

     <p>
      BOULDER, Colo. _ Nearly two years after JonBenet Ramsey was murdered in her home here on Christmas night, a grand jury investigation moves at a pace that many outsiders call leisurely.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second anniversary of the strangulation death of the beauty princess will find the 12 grand jurors on a five-week Christmas break. This comes after the jurors took one week off for Thanksgiving. During a 10-week stretch this fall, the panel met only 18 times to investigate the case, a murder mystery that has fascinated the nation and much of the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It's pretty amazing that they are taking a full month off, it seems more like a vacation than an investigation,'' said Craig Silverman, a Denver trial lawyer who is not involved in the case. ``They are still moving at this incredibly slow, Boulder pace. It is amazing the lack of urgency.''
     </p>
     <p>
      On Sept. 15, six months after the grand jury was impaneled for a one-year term, District Attorney Alexander Hunter of Boulder County took the case before the grand jury. If the grand jurors investigate the case into the spring, as expected, their term will be extended for an additional six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      This fall, the jurors heard testimony from a series of law-enforcement witnesses _ Boulder police detectives and officers and a state handwriting analyst. They also toured the Tudor-style house here where the Ramseys lived until JonBenet's death.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. In the summer of 1997, they sold their house here and moved to an Atlanta suburb.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
     </p>
     <p>
      On Tuesday, Bill Owens, Colorado's governor-elect, said he would resist calls for a special prosecutor.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I think a special prosecutor would have been necessary, had the grand jury not been called,'' Owens, a Republican, said. ``At this point, I am willing to await the results of the grand jury.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Critics of prosecutors here said that they had little experience investigating and trying homicides in Boulder, a college city that has about one murder a year. Indeed, in an unrelated case, Hunter's office on Friday won its first murder conviction here since 1992. To push the Ramsey case along, prosecutors from neighboring counties have lent to Hunter's office prosecutors with experience in homicides and grand juries.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Alex has gotten what many people feel he didn't have _ extremely competent grand jury prosecutors, prosecutors with a great depth of homicide experience,'' Bob Grant, district attorney for Adams County, said Tuesday. Noting that he had lent his chief trial deputy, Bruce Levin, to the case, Grant added, ``There really isn't any way to predict how long an investigative grand jury will go on.''
     </p>
     <p>
      As the grand jury has proved leak proof and as the murder case has grown cold, interest among news organizations has tapered off.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Starting in January 1997, at least one of the tabloids had JonBenet on their cover for 55 straight weeks,'' said Stan Oliner, manuscripts curator for the Colorado Historical Society. Noting a dwindling flow for the society's JonBenet Ramsey Manuscript Collection, he added: ``It has become an occasional story. The Lewinsky story has replaced the pounding, week after week, coverage of JonBenet.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Indeed, last week's headlines seemed to speak of a case frozen in time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last Friday evening, Ramsey attacked a free-lance photographer who tried to take his picture on a Boulder sidewalk, the photographer, Frank Coffman, said Tuesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``He charged right at me and grabbed hold of me with both hands and tried to throw me around a bit,'' Coffman said in an interview. Coffman said he did not intend to file charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mike Bynum, a lawyer and business partner of Ramsey who witnessed the encounter, did not return telephone calls Tuesday. Another business partner of Ramsey, Jay Elowsky, pleaded guilty earlier this year to misdemeanor assault charge after he brandished a baseball bat at two men he thought were newspaper reporters.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Denver newspaper also headlined last week: ``Ramsey Family DNA Sought.'' Five members of the Ramseys' extended family agreed to give Boulder police palm prints and DNA samples last week.
     </p>
     <p>
      As part of the ongoing investigation, detectives reportedly are trying to identify a mystery palm print found in the Ramsey basement and stray bits of DNA found under the little girl's fingernails. Knowing that unidentified DNA could bolster the theory that his daughter was murdered by a mysterious intruder, Ramsey wrote in a public letter Sept. 28: ``We have been told that the authorities have your DNA. They will know it is you.''
     </p>
     <p>
      ``If the DNA is not identified, it does weaken the prosecution's case,'' said Scott Robinson, a Denver defense lawyer who follows the case for several Denver news outlets. JonBenet's parents have already provided police with DNA samples, largely snippets of hair. The five family members who were scheduled to provide samples last week all have alibis placing them far from Boulder on the night of the murder.
