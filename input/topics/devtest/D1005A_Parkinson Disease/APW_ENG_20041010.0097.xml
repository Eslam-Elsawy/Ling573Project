Pope says his thoughts are with Roman Catholics at Mexico congress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking clearly and appearing in good form, Pope John Paul II said
Sunday that he was united in spirit with Roman Catholics attending a
congress in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The pontiff, who addressed a crowd in St. Peter's Square from a high
window, noted that the World Eucharistic Congress opened Sunday in
the Mexican city of Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
"I am spiritually united with this important ecclesiastic event," the
pope said in his weekly address.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government had invited the pontiff to make a sixth visit
to Mexico for the gathering. John Paul _ the most traveled pope in
history _ cut back on his trips a few years ago. The 84-year-old has
Parkinson's disease, which makes it difficult for him to walk and to
pronounce his words.
</P>
<P>
The congress, held every four years, allows Catholics to celebrate
their faith and unity. This year, it coincides with the beginning of
the Church's Year of the Eucharist. Catholics believe that Christ is
present in flesh and blood in the sacrament.
</P>
<P>
John Paul said that he had sent a letter to the world's Catholic
communities to mark the spiritual event, saying he trusted that "the
faithful are ready to testify (their belief in Christ) through acts
of charity."
