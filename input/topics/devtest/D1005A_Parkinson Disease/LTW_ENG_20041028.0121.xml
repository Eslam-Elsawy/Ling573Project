Walking Off Parkinson's

Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain
cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh
researchers report.
</P>
<P>
The loss of cells that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine causes
the telltale tremors, rigid and slow movements of Parkinson's. The
researchers gave rats a toxin that induces Parkinson's and then
counted dopamine-producing cells in the brains of rats that had
exercised for seven days and those that had not.
</P>
<P>
The rats that had been exercised had lost significantly fewer
neurons than the sedentary rats. The rats also had significantly
greater amounts of the protein GDNF, which the University of
Pittsburgh scientists speculate may protect brain cells from oxygen
damage produced by the disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have launched a small pilot study to see if regular
exercise can slow the progression of Parkinson's in people.
