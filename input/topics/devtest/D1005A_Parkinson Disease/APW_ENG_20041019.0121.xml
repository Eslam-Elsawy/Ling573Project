A team of Egyptian doctors examined Yasser Arafat after he suffered
from fever, nausea and a stuffy nose, an aide to Palestinian leader
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The health of the 75-year-old has been a subject of intense
speculation in recent years, in part because of the tremor in his
lips and hands, considered as a possible symptom of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Arafat suffered from gall stones, and his aides denied
rumors he had stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
An Arafat's aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said despite
the current flu-like symptoms, Arafat has observed the dawn-to-dusk
fast of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which began Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat no longer has fever or nausea, but the stuffy nose remains,
his aide said. Arafat felt strong enough Monday to preside over a
three-hour meeting with members of his Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat caught his cold last Tuesday, while walking in the windy
courtyard of his Ramallah headquarters, the aides said. That evening,
Arafat felt nauseous during dinner, couldn't finish is meal and went
to bed early, the aide added.
