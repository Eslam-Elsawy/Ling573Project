Del., N.J. Want More Study of Asian Oysters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maryland may be rushing crucial research on introducing Asian
oysters into the Chesapeake Bay, the states of Delaware and New Jersey
said this week, joining several federal agencies in asking that the
new species be studied further.
</P>
<P>
The states issued a statement saying that the Asian oyster is still
``a virtual unknown'' and could bring diseases or other ecological
problems that would spread to their coasts.
</P>
<P>
They urged officials in Maryland, where Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.
(R) has been a vocal proponent of the Asian oyster, not to make a
decision as scheduled early next year.
</P>
<P>
``I think their process would benefit from a little more
deliberation,'' said Roy Miller, administrator of fisheries for the
Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any
moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.
</P>
<P>
``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions
about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
</P>
<P>
The two states' criticism marks a new turn in the saga of
Crassostrea Ariakensis, a native of China that has recently caused
unusual divisions within the staid world of shellfish management.
</P>
<P>
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial
to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen --
has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
</P>
<P>
Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less
than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
``We're so low that the next stop is zero,'' said Pete Jensen, an
official with the Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that
have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake. But scientists
believe there are many potential downsides -- even beyond the
dinner-table prospects of an oyster that can resemble an orange
portobello mushroom cap.
</P>
<P>
Scientists point to the havoc caused in the bay ecosystem by other
nonnative species: The mute swan and beaverlike nutria chew up crucial
grasses, and the toothy northern snakehead has worried fishermen in
the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt
to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of
oysters and clams.
</P>
<P>
To answer such questions fully might take many years of research,
according to reports by the National Academy of Sciences and a trio of
federal agencies: the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental
Protection Agency and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Julie Thompson, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service,
said Wednesday that the federal agencies were concerned that the Asian
oyster would be impossible to remove once released in the wild.
</P>
<P>
``After it's done, it's going to be irreversible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Franks said Wednesday that all the necessary research has been
compressed into a year. That study, performed by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, could be finished in the next couple of weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
After that, Franks said, the data will be reviewed by a panel of
experts appointed by Ehrlich and Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D).
</P>
<P>
Based on their recommendations, Ehrlich and Warner will decide
whether to move forward on the oysters or to request more research,
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
Delaware and New Jersey will not have a say.
