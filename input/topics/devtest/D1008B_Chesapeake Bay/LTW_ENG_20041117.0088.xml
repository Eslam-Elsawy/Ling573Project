A Battle Won Against the Nutria

<P>
After struggling for decades against an
orange-toothed rodent that is eating the state's marshes, authorities
in Maryland have claimed their first major victory over the nutria.
</P>
<P>
The animals, which are blamed for thousands of acres of vanished
wetland statewide, have been eliminated from their former stronghold
in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, officials said.
</P>
<P>
All it took was two years, $2 million and 15 trappers working in
chest-deep muck here on the Eastern Shore. About 8,300 nutria were
killed during the eradication, which officials said was planned like a
military campaign, using Global Positioning System equipment.
</P>
<P>
In monetary terms, nutria cause about $2.8 million worth of
economic damage annually by reducing opportunities for hunting,
fishing and hiking, according to a report by the Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Although nutria remain in the state, Maryland is being lauded as a
rare success story in the government's fight against the pest, which
has colonized states from the Chesapeake Bay to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
``We proved it can be done,'' said Jonathan McKnight, an official
with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
The Blackwater refuge originally contained about 13,000 acres of
marshland, situated near the Chesapeake in Dorchester County. Nutria
were introduced there when a few of the South American animals either
escaped or were released from a federal fur research project in 1943.
</P>
<P>
For the nutria, which resemble waddling beavers with naked tails,
the area turned out to be a garden spot. There were huge expanses of a
marsh plant they love, called three-square bulrush.
</P>
<P>
For the bulrush, and the numerous species of birds, fish and
mammals that lived in the bulrush marshes, the news wasn't so good.
Nutria act like a ``mammalian lawn mower,'' in the words of scientist
Robert Thomas, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans --
eating the plants, roots and all, and leaving huge stretches of bare
mud.
</P>
<P>
Without roots to hold it, in many places the mud simply washed
away. About half of the refuge's marshland, a crucial pollution filter
that scientists call the ``kidneys'' of the Chesapeake, had become
open water by the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Authorities first offered rewards to trappers who caught nutria:
$1.50 apiece. But when nutria became difficult to find, trappers
decided the rodent wasn't worth their time. Any remaining animals --
blessed with an ability to produce more than 10 young in a year --
would then quickly repopulate.
</P>
<P>
``It's sort of like a whack-a-mole game,'' said Steve Kendrot, the
Department of Agriculture official in charge of Blackwater's trapping
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Government officials also tried to make nutria into a dinner-table
delicacy. That, too, failed: People who will eat nutria are pretty
much the same people who eat muskrat -- not much of a mass market.
</P>
<P>
``There's just not a lot of people out there who can stomach
them,'' said Dan Murphy of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake
office.
</P>
<P>
Including him: ``I don't eat rat,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the recent eradication effort was to use full-time
trappers, paid by the hour and not by the nutria. The trappers would
act like a conquering army, slowly taking territory in a west-to-east
march that was guided by GBS equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the summer, the trappers had to fend off mosquitoes and biting
greenhead flies. There were also spiders and the danger of the
occasional bite from a nutria's inch-long orange buckteeth.
</P>
<P>
Winter in the marsh, while often frigid, turned out to be the easy
season. Once the water froze, the nutria couldn't swim away, and
trappers could shoot them by the dozens on the ice.
</P>
<P>
``There's really about two months of the year when this is a
pleasant occupation,'' Kendrot said.
</P>
<P>
This September, the anti-nutria team got the news they were waiting
for: Surveys showed they had effectively cleared the animals from more
than 35,000 acres in and around Blackwater.
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the nutria death toll had been much lower than
they expected, since early speculation was that 50,000 ``nutes'' were
in the refuge. Scientists say the rest were killed by recent cold
winters or by a decline in food, as so much of the marsh already was
eaten. With the nutria gone, the marsh is starting to look the way it
did 70 years ago, officials said.

Officials in Maryland said they hope their success can be a model
for the roughly 16 other states with nutria problems.
</P>
<P>
But in Louisiana, the only state with a bigger nutria population
than Maryland's, authorities said they doubted whether a similar
eradication was possible there. Millions of nutria are in that swampy
state, and trappers routinely match the catch at Blackwater, about
8,300, in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
In Maryland, authorities say they want to slowly expand their
nutria-free zone to include the rest of the Eastern Shore, where tens
of thousands more nutria lurk between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and
Ocean City. The whole effort will require millions more in funding and
many more trappers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
``It was a major battle that has, for the most part, been won,''
said Jacoby Carter, a national expert on nutria for the U.S.
Geological Survey. ``But you've got to worry about the guerrilla
warfare.''
