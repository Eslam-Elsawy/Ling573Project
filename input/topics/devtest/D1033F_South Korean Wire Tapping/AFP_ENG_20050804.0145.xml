South Korean prosecutors said Thurday they 
have secured an arrest warrant for a former intelligence official 
accused of leaking a taped conversation detailing a slush fund 
payment by the Samsung Group.
</P>
<P>
Gong Un-Yong, 58, is accused of handing over the taped 
conversation to a Korean-American businessman who was arrested last 
week, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Gong has been hospitalized since he attempted to commit suicide 
nine days ago. He had left a note saying that the conversation was 
among recordings he kept at his home after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
Gong had headed a special wiretapping team from the National 
Intelligence Service, the main spy agency.
</P>
<P>
The businessman is suspected of leaking the conversation to the 
press after his attempt to blackmail Samsung failed.
</P>
<P>
The 19097 conversation is between Hong Seok-Hyun, a 
brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top 
official of the group.
</P>
<P>
It sparked suspicions that Hong, who later became South Korea's 
envoy to the United States, acted as an intermediary for Samsung and 
handed out slush funds to presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hong has offered to resign the ambassadorship.
</P>
<P>
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal 
to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling 
party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.    Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in the 1997 
presidential election. Lee retired from politics after he failed in 
his second presidential bid in 2002.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by 
businesses to politicians during the 2002 presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Businesses told investigators that they had made the donations 
for fear of reprisals from politicians.
