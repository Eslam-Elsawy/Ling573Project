<P>
South Korea's envoy to the United States 
has offered his resignation, bowing to pressure over his alleged 
involvement in a major political slush fund scandal, officials said 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh 
Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign, presidential spokesman 
Kim Man-Soo said, indicating Hong's resignation would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable as the ambassador has performed his job well 
at an important time," Roh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong, however, would be allowed to continue his job for the time 
being until Roh officially accepted his resignation, the spokesman 
said.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of his official resignation will depend on the 
settlement of his job," he said. Hong's resignation requires 
procedural steps such a letter recalling him from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Roh's Uri Party said the government should stop the 
envoy's resignation from hurting cooperation with the United States 
about ending a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons drive.
</P>
<P>
Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he 
might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest 
conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush 
funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The potentially explosive case came to light when a tape of a 
wiretapped conversation in 1997 between Hong and a top Samsung 
official was leaked to the press last week.
</P>
<P>
Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was 
named as ambassador to the United States in February. He is a 
brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
</P>
<P>
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal 
to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling 
party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.    Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a 
presidential election in late 1997. Lee retired from politics after 
he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A former intelligence official who attempted to commit suicide 
Tuesday left a note saying the taped conversation was among 
recordings kept at his home after his retirement and handed over to 
a Korean-American businessman, Yonhap news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In his note, Kong Un-Yong alleged that the businessman leaked 
copies of the taped conversation to the press after his attempt to 
blackmail Samsung broke down.
</P>
<P>
Kong, 58, who allegedly headed a special wiretapping unit, was 
unconscious in hospital after stabbing himself in the stomach, 
Yonhap said.
</P>
<P>
The suicide attempt came after Roh asked the National 
Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to 
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Civic groups have urged state prosecutors to investigate Lee, 
Hong and the Samsung chief.
</P>
<P>
Samsung apologized Monday over the issue but threatened to file 
a libel suit, accusing some media outlets of distorting and 
exaggerating the case.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by 
businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to 
political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides 
to Roh were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Businesses told investigators that they had donated illicit 
campaign funds for fear of reprisal from politicians if they did 
not.
