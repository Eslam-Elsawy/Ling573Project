ACTOR'S TRIAL, COMPLETE WITH PULP NOVEL CHARACTERS, DRAWS TO A CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the murder trial of Robert Blake, the
public has been privy to one bizarre scenario after another,
grist for a true-life pulp novel.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, observers in Van Nuys Superior Court
in Los Angeles have been fed a steady diet of
comic-book-style characters, a tattooed mobster-turned preacher, two strung-out stunt doubles
who say they had been solicited by Blake to double
as hit men; accounts of space aliens, experiments with crack-smoking
monkeys and salacious details of a love child.
</P>
<P>
These are the bits and pieces of the strange world of
Blake, the former television detective "Baretta," who is accused of
murdering his wife and soliciting the stuntmen to participate. His
wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, was a woman with a reputation
as a grifter and gold digger, who the defense contends
trapped Blake into an unloving marriage by becoming pregnant with
his child.
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald
Schwartzbach. "End this nightmare for Mr. Blake," he said, "and
you will give him back his life."
</P>
<P>
The jurors must decide if Blake pulled the trigger, which would
put him in prison for the rest of his life,
and if he solicited the two stuntmen, each count carrying
a maximum penalty of nine years.
