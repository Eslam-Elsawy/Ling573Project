<P>
Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor's
celebrity shouldn't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurors
Wednesday in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
Blake ambushed his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, killing her after several other
people refused to do the job for him, prosecutor Shellie Samuels
argued.
</P>
<P>
"That's what this case is all about, the defendant getting what he wants,"
Samuels said. "And if he can't get someone else to do it, he'll do it
himself."
</P>
<P>
The star of television's "Baretta" and the movie "In Cold Blood" should be
treated like any other person accused of murder, Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
"The implication of counsel in opening argument is that Robert Blake is being
prosecuted because he is Robert Blake and a regular John Doe wouldn't be
prosecuted under the same circumstances," Samuels said. "That is a blatantly
ridiculous argument."
</P>
<P>
Samuels told jurors that Blake despised Bakley but cautioned that her background
should not be an issue in their verdict.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that Blake married Bakley because of their baby, Rosie, and
then was determined to keep the child away from the mother who sold promises of
sex by mail. Blake also suspected her of using another of her children for
pornography and allegedly once called her family "monsters."
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, is accused of murdering Bakley less than six months after their
marriage. Prosecutors allege Blake shot her outside his favorite restaurant in
Studio City after failing to persuade two former stuntmen to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
Samuels had only a circumstantial case to present. No eyewitnesses, blood or DNA
evidence linked Blake to the crime scene. The murder weapon could not be traced
to Blake and experts testified the tiny amounts of gunshot residue found on
Blake's hands could have come from a different gun he said he carried for
protection.
</P>
<P>
In his closing, defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach was likely to continue the
line he took during trial, attacking the credibility of the two key
witnesses:
</P>
<P>
_ Gary McLarty, a former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user, said
Blake offered him $10,000 and "insinuated" that he wanted Bakley
dead.
</P>
<P>
_ Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited
him to kill his wife. However, until six months after the crime, he denied
knowing anything about such a plot.
</P>
<P>
After closing arguments, the jury could get the case on Friday.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special
circumstance of lying in wait, Blake could be sentenced to life in prison. He
spent nearly a year in jail before being released on $1.5 million
bail.
</P>
<P>
Bakley, 44, was shot as she sat in a car near Blake's favorite restaurant, where
they had dined on May 4, 2001. Blake contends he was in the restaurant at the
time, retrieving a handgun he carried for protection.
