<P>
Robert Blake's defense rested its case without calling him to the stand, but he
was able to tell jurors his story in a videotape of a TV interview that was
played in court.
</P>
<P>
"It's all about Rosie," he said, referring to the baby he had with slain wife
Bonny Lee Bakley. "It's always been about Rosie. The greatest gift in the world,
and I'm going to try to mess it up by being selfish?"
</P>
<P>
The final day of Blake's extensive defense case also featured his adult
daughter, Delinah Blake-Hurwitz, testifying Wednesday about her adoption of the
child and undergoing such a rigorous cross-examination by the prosecutor that
many of the questions went unanswered when the judge ruled they were
argumentative.
</P>
<P>
Rosie was seen by jurors for the first time during the videotape of the Barbara
Walters interview, which showed Blake with the little girl on his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001. They had been married the
previous November after tests showed Blake was the father of the
baby.
</P>
<P>
Following the defense's presentation, which featured 38 witnesses, the
prosecutor said she would put on a rebuttal case calling more witnesses
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution case depended heavily on the testimony of two retired stuntmen
who said that Blake solicited them to kill Bakley. Other witnesses spoke of his
anxiety when he found out Bakley was pregnant and his desire to get her out of
his life but to keep the baby that he loved.
</P>
<P>
In the defense case, the ex-stuntmen were attacked as drug addicts prone to
hallucinations and delusions.
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, a lifelong actor who starred in the 1970s TV detective show
"Baretta," could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
In the interview video, which was recorded when Blake was in Los Angeles County
jail, he was clad in an orange jumpsuit and his eyes were reddened.
</P>
<P>
He appeared agitated as Walters questioned him about why he had not divorced
Bakley. He said there was no need to divorce her because they were going to make
a go of it.
</P>
<P>
"What did I have to lose?" he said. "God gave me the gift of the century. I
always thought my life was a home run. Now, at the end of the trail, I was going
to get to hit the ball out of the universe."
</P>
<P>
Blake mentioned that he knew she was doing "her business" from his house and "I
was going to take care of that." He said that she had another house in suburban
Thousand Oaks and she could do it there.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have said that Bakley conducted a mail-order scam in which she coaxed
men to send her money with promises of sex.
</P>
<P>
Blake described himself to Walters as "an old man" and said he had been spending
his time picking up women in bars, suggesting that his relationship with Bakley
and the birth of the baby was an improvement.
</P>
<P>
The court was packed as Blake's adult daughter took the stand.
</P>
<P>
Married and pregnant with her own child, Blake-Hurwitz said that when she first
met Rosie, the child was a 4-month-old who was withdrawn, kept folding herself
into a fetal position and didn't make eye contact with anyone.
</P>
<P>
Blake-Hurwitz, a psychology professor, said she immediately arranged for a
friend to take Rosie to a pediatrician. Within three weeks, Rosie was gaining
weight and "giggling," she said.
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination, prosecutor Shellie Samuels angrily accused the witness of
ending a previous marriage because her husband didn't want children. The
implication appeared to be that Blake wanted the baby in order to give his
daughter a child.
</P>
<P>
Blake-Hurwitz said that's what her ex-husband may have believed, but it was not
her reason for the annulment.
