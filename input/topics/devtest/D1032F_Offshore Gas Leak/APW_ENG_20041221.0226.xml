Statoil expects to restart Snorre A oil production this week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore
petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural
gas leak shut down operations.
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled oil company said it hopes full production from
Snorre and the satellite field Vigdis will resume by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
Snorre A, a steel tension-leg platform, was shut down Nov. 28 after a
gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180 workers. The shutdown
of Snorre and the Vigdis field meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil
a day in production, or 6.4 percent of Norway's roughly 3.2 million
barrels a day of production.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it
and prevent any further leaks.
</P>
<P>
"A startup depends in part on maintaining our schedule for the
remaining work," said Oivind Reinertsen, Statoil's senior vice
president for the Tampen cluster of fields, which includes Snorre.
</P>
<P>
"We must also complete the planned inspection program with a positive
result. But if everything goes according to plan, we should be back
in normal operation before Dec. 31," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statoil also said it submitted a report on its progress in sealing
the well to the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Tuesday, and
that resuming crude oil flows also depends on the authority giving
the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee the nation's
petroleum interests, and employs about 17,000 people in 25 countries.
The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the state sold a 17.5
percent stake to investors.
