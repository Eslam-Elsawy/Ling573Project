Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal
off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had
been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
A team of about 30 workers was tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is still serious," Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for
the Norwegian oil group Statoil which operates the Snorre A offshore
platform, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to seal the leak so that we can resume production as
early as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a risk that gas leaking from an injection shaft might
explode, 180 of 216 workers on the Snorre A platform were evacuated
by helicopter on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of operations means a loss of 130,000 barrels per day
(bpd) out of a total of some three million bpd normally produced by
Norway, the world's third-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Statoil said it did not know when production would be able to resume.
</P>
<P>
"Safety is our biggest priority right now. All other considerations
will have to wait," Oeivind Reinertsen, a senior Statoil executive,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reinertsen described the incident as "serious and rare".
</P>
<P>
Activities at the neighbouring Snorre B platform were not affected
for the time being, Hetland said.
</P>
<P>
Workers on the Snorre A platform were to be replaced by a new team on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Snorre field is operated by Statoil, which owns a 14.39 percent
share, as well as the Norwegian state-owned group Petoro, ExxonMobil
of the United States, Idemitsu Petroleum of Japan, RWE Dea of
Germany, Total of France, Amerada Hess of the US and Enterprise Oil
of Britain.
