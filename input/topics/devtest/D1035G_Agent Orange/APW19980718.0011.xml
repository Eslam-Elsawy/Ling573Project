     HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is launching a support fund for victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after its use by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday. The paper quoted Nguyen Trong Nhan, chairman of the Vietnam Red Cross, as saying those affected by the toxic chemical will receive assistance from the fund by the year 2000 after a survey on Agent Orange victims is completed next year. The fund, which primarily will rely on donations from domestic and foreign organizations and individuals, will be inaugurated next Friday. It will be managed by the Red Cross, which will provide loans and training to victims. They include former soldiers who fought in areas sprayed with Agent Orange by U.S. aircraft and children who were later born with deformities. Nhan said the government's strained budget might have delayed assistance, pointing out that a laboratory test of a sample for Agent Orange costs dlrs 3,000. Prime Minister Phan Van Khai in April assigned the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs to conduct a survey on the estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam.
