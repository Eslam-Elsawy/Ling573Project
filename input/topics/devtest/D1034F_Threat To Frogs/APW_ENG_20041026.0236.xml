Airport authorities have detained three Belgians accused of smuggling
some 600 rare frogs into the country from Panama, news reports said
Tuesday.

<P>
The frogs are protected species and are valued at up to euro250
(US$300) a piece for collectors in Europe, Belgian media reported.

<P>
The three suspects were arrested last week at Brussels airport after
customs agents grew suspicious about the large number of film rolls
the three were carrying.

After inspecting the plastic film containers, agents found the
brightly colored animals hidden inside.

Some of the frogs had survived the trip and were taken to the Antwerp
zoo, the reports said.
