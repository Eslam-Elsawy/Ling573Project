It's not easy being green, Australia's only frog hospital set to 
croak

After six-and-a-half years of mending 
broken legs and treating disease, Australia's only frog hospital is 
closing its doors due to a lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
Cairns Frog Hospital in northern Queensland state, which at 
times had as many as 200 sick amphibians in its care, has had to 
close down because of unsustainable costs, founder Deborah 
Pergolotti told AFP on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking in any more cases," she said, adding that the 
hospital had been hit by an increase in sick frogs being brought in 
and a reluctance by Australians to pay for the medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
While some frogs cost only 20-30 dollars (US dollars) to treat, 
others can cost more than 100 dollars, Pergolotti said.
</P>
<P>
She warned of an increase in the number of previously 
unrecognised frog diseases which could indicate broader 
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Typical symptoms included changes in skin colour, lethargy and 
weight loss, she said.
</P>
<P>
"These are new and unrecognised diseases. Because we know so 
little about them, we get as much lab work done as we can afford," 
Pergolotti said.
</P>
<P>
However the hospital, which she runs out of her two-bedroom 
house, could no longer afford these tests as well as the live 
insects for meals, vet fees and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, which is part of the Frog Decline Reversal 
Project, received no government funding, she said, adding this may 
have been because frogs were not "iconic" Australian animals such as 
koalas or kangaroos.
</P>
<P>
"There may be an issue with frogs, that they are not warm and 
fuzzy," she said.
