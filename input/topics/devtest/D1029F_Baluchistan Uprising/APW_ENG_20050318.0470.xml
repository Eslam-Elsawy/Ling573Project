<P>
A fierce gunbattle between paramilitary troops and renegade tribesmen left eight
soldiers dead and 23 others wounded in an insurgency-wracked area of
southwestern Pakistan, a troop spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials failed to provide information on casualties among the tribesmen in
Thursday's clashes, but denied tribal elders' claims that dozens of civilians
had died.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a bomb exploded in the toilet of a train elsewhere in restive
Baluchistan province on Friday, killing one person and wounding five others, two
critically, police said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, that happened as
the train stopped in a station in the town of Mach, near Quetta, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
It follows a series of small explosions targeting Baluchistan's railways in the
past two months and blamed on ethnic Baluch nationalists.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of
troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300
kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital,
Quetta.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing battle lasted 16 hours, ending early Friday after the two sides
agreed on a cease-fire, said a Frontier Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik.
He said eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured but gave no details on any
casualties among the attackers or other tribespeople.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources on Thursday told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity that at least 16 tribesmen were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at
Sui. Clashes between troops and tribesmen demanding more returns from the
natural resources extracted on their territory are common. Baluchistan was
rocked by a tribal insurgency in the 1970s and violence has surged again this
year.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of supporters from ethnic Baluch nationalist parties on Friday staged a
protest outside the provincial assembly in Quetta against what they said were
high civilian casualties from Thursday's clashes.
</P>
<P>
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, an opposition politician and former Baluchistan chief
minister, claimed the army had "ruthlessly" killed over 50 innocent people,
including women, children and minority Hindus in Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was concealing civilian deaths, and called for a
seven-day period of mourning in the province.
</P>
<P>
No government official was immediately available Friday to answer Mengal's
claim. On Thursday, Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told Parliament in
Islamabad, "There were some casualties, but it is wrong to say that 40 or 70
people were killed."
</P>
<P>
Sherpao said the troops opened fire only when they came under
attack.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main
gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight
people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the
country.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the tribesmen's claims for
greater royalties from the gas reserves and their other grievances. It is
expected to make its recommendations to the government soon.
