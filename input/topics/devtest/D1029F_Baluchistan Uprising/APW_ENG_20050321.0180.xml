Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets
during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive
tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week, a government official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in the town of Dera Bugti erupted last Thursday after the tribesmen
allegedly attacked a convoy of pickup trucks carrying paramilitary troops along
a mountain road.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in
the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate
Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the
country's poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the
natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up
garrisons in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Samad Lasi, the top government administrator in the area, said Monday that
several homes of Hindus near the temple in Dera Bugti also were damaged by
rockets in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
"This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was severely
damaged," Lasi said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides were shooting at each other. It is difficult to say whose fire
destroyed the temple," Lasi told The Associated Press by satellite telephone
from inside a base at Dera Bugti where government officials and paramilitary
troops are surrounded by armed tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Awais Ahmed Ghani, the governor of southwestern Baluchistan province
where Dera Bugti is located, said some 300 troops and government officials are
holed up at the base. Helicopters were airlifting them supplies.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen have reportedly set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads
into Dera Bugti. Lasi said they had dug more trenches about 500 to 1,000 meters
(yards) from the base.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti
tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their
families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185
miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in
mountains near Dera Bugti. Tribal chief Nawab Akbar Bugti vowed to fight the
government, saying hundreds of his supporters were ready to face the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150
of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near
Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
</P>
<P>
Registration of a case is seen as the first step by the government before
arresting someone wanted for wrongdoing. Nausherwani said no arrests have been
made so far.
</P>
<P>
Dera Bugti is a remote district with population of 84,000, about 50,000 living
inside the town, including a small community of Hindus. Pakistan is an Islamic
state, but about 3 percent of its 150 million people are from other faiths,
mostly Hindus and Christians.
