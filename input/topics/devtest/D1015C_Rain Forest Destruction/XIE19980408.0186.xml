     China Taking Steps To Protect Tropical Rain Forest (1)

      KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.

      Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.

      Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen, stopping cold air from the north, while warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain.

      This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.

      Xishuangbanna has at least 58 species of rare or endangered plants, 15 percent of China's total number, and it is home to 102 species of mammals and 427 species of birds, a quarter and a third of China's total, respectively.

      Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says.

      The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, and after nearly four decades it has grown to 247,000 ha with most of the rain forest.

      The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare plants to a special 90-ha area for protection.
