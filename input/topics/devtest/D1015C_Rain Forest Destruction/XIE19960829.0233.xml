      RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests.
     </p>
     <p>
      The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.

     <p>
      The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
     </p>
     <p>
      Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that.
     </p>
     <p>
      Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in Amazon's Pantanal wetlands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
     </p>
     <p>
      Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years.
