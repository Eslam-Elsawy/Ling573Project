      HAIKOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from across China today called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black gibbons in southern China's Hainan province.

      A total of 150 experts and professors from 25 research institutes and colleges across the country have launched the nationwide appeal. They called on government departments to participate in and mobilize social forces to enhance the construction and management of a natural protection zone on Bawangling Mountain, where black gibbons live.

      Located in the western part of Hainan province, Bawangling Mountain boasts more than 1,000 varieties of wild animals, with over 40 kinds belonging to rare animals.

      In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties. Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.

      Now there are only 15 to 20 gibbons remaining in the mountain area.

      Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest. They have the same skeletal structure as humans -- four limbs, facial features, internal organs, and similar blood as human and they are physiologically, psychologically and mentally similar to human beings.

      Gibbons are of high research value, regarded by many as precious as giant pandas in China, according to experts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many international and foreign organizations have paid close attention to the protection of gibbons. They sent teams to conduct on-the-spot studies, established research centers, provide funds and publish information to generate world wide attention to their plight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hainan provincial government department has vowed to set up a foundation for the protection of gibbons, and to prevent and crack down on activities which threaten the life of gibbons.
