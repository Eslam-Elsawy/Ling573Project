     WASHINGTON, D.C. 20003 Tel: 202-547-4512 Fax: 202-546-4194 COPYRIGHT 1998 BY WORLDSOURCES, INC., A JOINT VENTURE OF FDCH, INC. AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. JAKARTA (JP): Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro revealed here yesterday that former president Soeharto has appointed a number of lawyers to represent him. ``Yes that's true,'' Soedjono replied hastily when asked by journalists. When pressed further he revealed that he had also recently met with them. ``They (lawyers) submitted a letter on their power of attorney,'' he said. Soedjono refused to divulge further details, saying only that there were ``several of them''. When pressed if they would be defending the former president, Soedjono evasively retorted: ``They are conducting their job in accordance with their code of ethics to defend truth and justice''. He said when asked why he himself was not Soeharto legal council that: ``Soeharto is now a private citizen so he has the right to be represented by private lawyers. He's nothing (not a public official) now.'' Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office. Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the Soeharto clan's wealth.
