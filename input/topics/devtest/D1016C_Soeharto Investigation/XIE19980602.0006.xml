      addressing a gathering on Sunday at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the capital, Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais has asked Soeharto to donate his wealth to the nation and also called on Indonesians to forgive the former president who had made great contribution to the country.

      Soeharto, who had ruled Indonesia for the last 32 years, resigned on May 21 under the heavy pressure from the people demanding for total reforms in political, economic and legal fields.

      The new government led by B.J. Habibie has promised to carry out the reforms and to be free from corruption, collusion and nepotism.
