      JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib pledged to hunt state assets which were allegedly stashed overseas during the 32-year rule of former president Soeharto, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.

      "We will consult with the Foreign Ministry to rescue the state assets stashed overseas," Ghalib told reporters after meeting Swiss Ambassador to Indonesia Gerard Fonjallaz at his office Friday.

      Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said earlier this week that his ministry was ready to assist the Attorney General's Office in rescuing state assets possibly stashed abroad during the Soeharto era.

      "We will make the best of this offer... the minister of foreign affairs (Ali Alatas) has also offered to cooperate," Ghalib said.

      Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.

      The purpose of his visit is to explain that Switzerland's banking secrecy is "not absolute" as long as there is a formal demand from a particular country to launch investigations into a suspected bank account, he said.

      "We would not take the initiative (to launch the investigation), it has to come from the country of origin of the person (suspected of having illegally-gained deposits)," he added.

      Ghalib came under fire after he said on Monday that he believed Soeharto's public denial of charges that he had accumulated a fortune worth billions of U.S. dollars during his rule.

      Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, I don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at foreign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
     </p>

      American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.
