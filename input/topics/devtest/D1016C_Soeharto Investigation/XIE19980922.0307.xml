      JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.

     <p>
      "With this letter of authorization, I can go anywhere in the world to search accounts that may be held by Soeharto," Ghalib was quoted by the newspaper The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
     </p>
     <p>
      Without such a letter, it will be hard for the team to ask foreign banks to open their records due to long-established banking secrecy policies, he added.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
     </p>
     <p>
      A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib said without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas.

      But Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in a statement broadcast by his own daughter's television station early this month.

      Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating Soeharto's wealth.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The government is serious in investigating Soeharto's personal fortune. Should there be indications (that this wealth was amassed illegally), the government will pursue the case and take legal action," he told reporters.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said the special team tasked to investigate the former president has already scheduled a meeting with Soeharto.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Yes, Soeharto will receive the team soon," Tanjung said.
