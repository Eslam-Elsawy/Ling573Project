<P>
Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday 
added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a 
potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall 
yet.
</P>
<P>
The total number of affected goods, ranging from 
ready-made-meals to popular sauces, came to 474 after a previous 
list of some 430 items issued by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) was 
found to have a number of duplications, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye 
Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are reminded that the risk is very small, that there 
is no risk of immediate illness but it is sensible not to eat 
affected products," it said.
</P>
<P>
"No groups, whether young, in hospital, elderly or pregnant are 
exposed to anything other than a very small risk."
