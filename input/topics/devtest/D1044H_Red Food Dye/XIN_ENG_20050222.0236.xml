<P>
Cyprus health services have advised
people not to eat foods imported from Britain that have 
contaminated an illegal dye named Sudan I, local press reported 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The advice came after Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA) last
week issued a warning that some 350 food products may be affected 
and should be withdrawn from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
The foods, including soups, sauces and ready meals, have been 
distributed widely.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Health Ministry has advised consumers not to eat 
contaminated foodstuffs, and restaurants, takeaways and hotels not 
to serve these food.
</P>
<P>
The restaurants and hotels should also report to the authorities
whether they have already purchased any affected product.
</P>
<P>
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, 
petrol and shoe and floor polishes. It is not allowed to be added 
to food in the Europe Union.
