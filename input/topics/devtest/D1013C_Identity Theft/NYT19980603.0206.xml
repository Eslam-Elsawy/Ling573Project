      The Nixon administration did it. So did Oliver North. And so does Carole Harris.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shred, that is.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every day during the summer, Ms. Harris, 65, opens her mail on the sun porch of her summer cottage in Buchanan, N.Y. She sorts it, then shreds what she doesn't need in her $29 Royal Jaws personal shredder, which sits on top of her wastebasket.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I had always torn up my charge receipts into pieces before putting them in the wastebasket,'' she said. Then last fall, she said, she watched an NBC News report on how thieves needed only a name and address to steal a person's identity, using that information to set up fraudulent credit accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I thought, well, if I've got to tear up envelopes and anything with names and addresses, that's a lot'' to do by hand or with scissors, she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The popularity of personal shredders has increased tremendously in the past few years, said Jean Papagni, a Staples spokeswoman. After the NBC News report in November, she said, there was an uptick in sales, then steady sales throughout the holidays and into tax season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fear of so-called identity fraud _ said to be the nation's fastest-growing type of consumer fraud _ is reason enough for some people to buy shredders, said Todd W. Henreckson, director of the General Binding Corp.'s Shredmaster division, in Northbrook, Ill.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``The public's becoming paranoid _ and not in an unreasonable nature _ about their personal identity,'' he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shredders have been around since the 1930s, and they became part of the public vernacular during the Watergate years in the 1970s. The Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s and a range of scandals in the 1990s drew more attention to shredders. For a long time, only government agencies and corporations could afford them or the space it took to store the shredders, which cost thousands of dollars and took up about six cubic feet apiece.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then in 1990, Fellowes Manufacturing, the leading maker of shredders, introduced two desktop versions, which sold for $149 and $199. Other companies began making the machines, and prices some 100,000 shredders were sold in that year in the United States and Canada.
     </p>
     <p>
      Based on recent sales, manufacturers estimate that 3 million personal shredders will be sold this year in stores like Staples, Office Max, Office Depot, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Sears, making the machines the fastest-growing home office product.
     </p>
     <p>
      The buyers of small shredders include schools, people working at home and professionals like lawyers, doctors and tax preparers. Just the thought of someone rifling through their garbage is motivation enough for many people to buy shredders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that the minute garbage is put out to be picked up, it becomes part of the public domain and is no longer private.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a newsletter based in Washington, said shredding documents was smart because ``identity theft is a growing problem to the extent of becoming a national epidemic.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Shredders appeal to people like Carol Story, a member of a co-op board on the New York's Upper West Side who plans to ask the board to buy one. She routinely has to shred by hand or with scissors applications that are two or three inches thick. ``We get people's private information, a lot of it,'' she said. ``What do you do with it? I spend a fair amount of time destroying these papers. I sit in front of the television and shred it myself.''
     </p>
     <p>
      To protect personal information, shredders aren't the last line of defense. While shredders can help prevent the theft of personal information from garbage, professional thieves often steal things like credit card applications in the mail.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It's like the wild, wild West out there,'' Hendricks said, ``and to protect your privacy you have to be Jesse James.'' He recommends that you try to keep private any information like names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names and driver's license numbers. You should also check your credit report once a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Perhaps not surprisingly, retired people, like Ms. Harris, seem to be on the leading edge of shredder buying. Tony Storrie, vice president and general manager of the Fellowes Powershred Division in Itasca, Ill., said: ``A lot of retired or elderly people who have a lifetime's worth of documents are also sensitive to the criminal issues. They are more likely to take precautions.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms. Harris enjoys her Royal shredder so much that she bought a shredder for each of her four children, and she plans to take her shredder back home to Harrisburg, Pa., in the fall and use it there for the rest of the year. She shreds the name and address labels that she tears off envelopes and catalogs, along with credit card receipts and credit card applications. ``It's there all the time,'' she said. ``I use it every day.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Choosing a Shredder
     </p>
     <p>
      Choosing among personal shredders depends upon how you intend to use the machine and, more important, how much security you feel you need.
     </p>
     <p>
      WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL DO YOU WANT TO SHRED?
     </p>
     <p>
      _Junk mail, documents from work, tax information? That determines the throat size needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      HOW OFTEN DO YOU EXPECT TO USE IT?
     </p>
     <p>
      _That will help you decide how many sheets you want the machine to handle at once.
     </p>
     <p>
      DOES IT MATTER WHICH TYPE OF CUT THE SHREDDER MAKES?
     </p>
     <p>
      _Some shredders cut paper in spaghetti-like strips, while others cross-cut to make what resembles confetti.
     </p>
     <p>
      The portable Shredmaster Confidential from GBC, for example, weighs two pounds and costs $24.99. It is good for shredding ATM and credit card receipts, but a standard sheet of paper must be folded in half before shredding. More practical for light use is the company's best-selling model, the 40S, which sells for $29.99 and weighs four pounds. In an unscientific test, the unit performed nicely on up to three stapled sheets of regular-sized paper, but it slowed when fed four and five sheets. With the long, thin strips, your wastebasket is likely to fill up quickly (a plus if you need packing material).
     </p>
     <p>
      If you believe those spaghetti strips could somehow be pieced together, you can spend more for a cross-shredder, which reduces your potentially revealing documents to tiny pieces of paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fellowes's Powershred PS60 CC, a cross-cutter that costs $159.99, works like a paper tiger, chewing up to seven sheets at a pass. The biggest drawback, however, is its size and weight _ it weighs 18 pounds. It is hard to lift the shredder on and off the wastebasket it comes with.
     </p>
     <p>
      Less impressive is the GBC 55X cross-cutter, which sells for $99, weighs 12 pounds and is supposedly designed for up to three sheets at a time. The machine works noticeably hard to make its confetti. Two sheets are about as much as it can take before getting stuck. Once the shredder sticks, you have to use the reverse and forward buttons to free the paper. If that doesn't work, you have to unplug it and turn it upside down for a good shake.
     </p>
     <p>
      Speaking of getting stuck, all the shredders display warnings regarding long hair, jewelry and ties: all candidates for getting caught in the machines.
