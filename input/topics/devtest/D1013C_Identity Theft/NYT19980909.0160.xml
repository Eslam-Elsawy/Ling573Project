     VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT NOW HELPS OTHERS SNARED BY SCAMS

      SAN FRANCISCO _ If someone steals your name and runs up lots of bills with it, how do you clear things up? Slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      It took Mari Frank two years and became an obsession.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I've been through identity-theft hell and I survived,'' said Frank, 50. ``I had to write 90 letters and spent 500 hours working to clear my name.''
     </p>
     <p>
      But Frank, an attorney in Orange County, Calif., turned her ordeal into a service for other victims: She has compiled a guide to help others avoid the same problems. She has created an ``Identity Theft Survival Kit,'' written a book and pamphlets, and produced computer discs with sample letters to send to banks, creditors and credit reporting agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I've become a reluctant expert,'' Frank said. ``I found out more than I ever wanted to know about this.''
     </p>
     <p>
      She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I said: There must be some mistake. I don't have a credit card with you,''' said Frank, an adjunct professor at the Western State College of Law in Fullerton.
     </p>
     <p>
      She didn't. She'd been scammed.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It was technology rape,'' she said.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Ventura County woman had somehow gotten hold of Frank's Social Security number and other personal data. The woman set up a series of fraudulent lines of credit, ordering credit cards, starting checking accounts and having Frank's mail sent to a different address. The impostor ran up about $100,000 worth of bills.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``She even bought a car using my name,'' Frank said. ``And then she didn't keep up her payments. ... Bills in my name were being sent to Ventura (Calif.). I'd never even stopped there before.''
     </p>
     <p>
      The scam apparently had been going on for at least a year. After spending thousands of dollars, Frank believes she has finally cleared her name with the Bank of New York and other creditors including Thrifty Rental Car, which was threatening to sue her after the impostor trashed a car.
     </p>
     <p>
      The impostor, Tracy Lloyd, eventually pleaded guilty to six counts of felony fraud but spent no time behind bars, Frank said.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``This woman stalked me. If she had used the .22 Beretta handgun she had in her possession at the time of her arrest to steal that money, she would still be behind bars. But instead she used a pen, a computer and the telephone. She drove home from the courthouse in the same red convertible Mustang that she bought with my name.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Repairing the damage can be difficult, time-consuming and frustrating. Frank and other experts said that victims of identity theft often become depressed. There is now a support group called Victims of Identity Theft (310-397-3004).
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It's a fight for your credit and your sanity,'' Frank said. ``There's post-traumatic stress disorder that occurs from this crime. Most of the time you don't know who is doing it, and the perpetrators never get caught.''
