     GORE OUTLINES PLANS FOR STRONGER ONLINE PRIVACY
    </headline>
    (lb) By JOEL BRINKLEY c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

     <p>
      WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced a new privacy initiative Friday aimed at protecting children and medical patients, among others. But while the proposals were ambitious, the administration can enforce few of them without the consent of Congress or private industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the proposals are simply endorsements of bills already wending their way through Congress. Others require new congressional action that is, in some cases, uncertain at best.
     </p>
     <p>
      But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to many in Congress and to public-interest groups. Gore announced instead that, for now, the administration would leave industry to regulate itself.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government's privacy rules are of special concern now because the European Union plans to enforce a new electronic privacy program in October and has threatened to stop doing business with companies in other countries that have looser rules. In congressional testimony earlier this week, Commerce Secretary William Daley said the administration's new proposals would bring the United States into compliance. But some experts in privacy law disagree.
     </p>
     <p>
      The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of medical and banking records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services would propose a new rule next week to enhance the security of electronic medical records, but offered no details.
     </p>
     <p>
      And federal bank regulators will strengthen the enforcement of a law that sets limits on how easily banks can share information about their customers and their accounts with related business, such as insurance companies, according to a senior administration official.
     </p>
     <p>
      The goal, Gore said, was ``to ensure that account-holders have the chance to give a thumbs-down or a thumbs-up before banks hand out sensitive information about their accounts.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to others to implement. For example, Gore said he wanted to discourage ``profiling'' _ the practice by some companies of building dossiers on the activities of private citizens using a variety of databases and then using or selling that information to other businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We are working with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a new challenge to companies that use information technology to piece together personal profiles of American citizens and then sell those profiles for profit,'' the vice president said. ``And here is the message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you protect the privacy of all Americans.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such as credit-card fraud.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gore also urged Congress to pass a law that would forbid companies running sites on the World Wide Web to collect information about children under 13 visiting the sites without permission from their parents. ``Before children innocently forfeit personal information, parents should have a say,'' the vice president said.

      Experts in privacy regulation found few new ideas in the White House initiative. David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a private research group based in Washington, said, ``We didn't hear much here that we haven't heard before, and the gaping hole in their policy continues to be Internet privacy'' for adults.
     </p>
     <p>
      Evan Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times newsletter, said: ``In form and ceremony, it's a great day. But in substance this leaves a lot wanting.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Sobel also said the proposals ``still leave us out of step with Europe.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Hendricks agreed, saying: ``This does hardly anything to deal with the coming problem with Europe. It leaves us on a collision course with the EU.''
