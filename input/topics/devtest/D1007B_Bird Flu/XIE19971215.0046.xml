      HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird flu" that has killed two people.
     </p>
     <p>
      A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises representatives from various government departments, will hold its first meeting Tuesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.

     <p>
      Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a new strain of the flu.
     </p>
     <p>
      The move came after three more people were suspected last week to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.

      A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old man died early this month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three more people remained hospitalized.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government also announced today that authorities in the neighboring Guangdong Province have agreed to step up the monitoring of chicken diseases at farms there.
     </p>
     <p>
      A statement said Guangdong also plans to restrict chicken exports to Hong Kong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Experts say they are baffled by the virus, and the hospital authority has issued guidelines to the public and hospitals to treat the potentially deadly flu.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market, according to a source from the local health department.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three more experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to help in the investigation, the source said.

      The World Health Organization has reportedly been asked to alert vaccine production centers worldwide to follow developments with a view to preparing the necessary vaccine.
