      No bird flu case has been found in Macao and people should stay calm, experts from the Macao Nurses' Association and the Public Health Department said.

      But they did urge people to be careful in contacting birds, take care of proper personal and environmental hygiene and cook their food thoroughly.

      Leung Iok Va, deputy-secretary-general of the Macao Nurses' Association, told the Macao Daily News today that there is no effective way of prevention as the cause and way of transmission of the bird flu on human beings have not been found.

      Meanwhile, local dealers of imported fowls said imported chickens, ducks and geese are safe to eat because they have passed strict examinations before they are put on the local market.

      The poultry imported from China's inland areas are from a different source from those imported by Hong Kong, they said. While Hong Kong's imports mostly come from Shenzhen, Macao's are mainly from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities.

      The experts want local residents to buy poultry only at licensed food stalls, saying those sold by illegal mobile vendors might be unsafe.
