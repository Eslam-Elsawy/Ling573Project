      Kazen Abul, a social worker in close contact with the experiment in the country, told Kuwait News Agency that "hypnotherapy of obesity has made an unprecedented success in Kuwait. The number of people coming to clinics for this particular treatment is on the rise."

      He said up to 700 obese people were satisfied with the results of hypnotherapy.

      Kuwait has a large percentage of obesity cases among its 700,000 citizens, especially women, because of less activities and unrational food structure.
