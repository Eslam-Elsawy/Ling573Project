      ABU DHABI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A massive increase in the incidence of diabetes has been forecast for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals unless education and preventive measures are taken, a medical study said.

      About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.

      The study, involving 2,000 UAE nationals aged between 30 and 80 years, found diabetes in the UAE to be particularly widespread among the elderly and less educated social groups.

      The study attributed the reason to the increasing incidence of obesity among UAE nationals, which is strongly linked to diabetes.

      Doctors said common sense should be applied and they suggested nationals to eat more fruits, cereals and vegetables which were cited as the best sources to avoid diabetes.

      The UAE has a 2.4 million population, but about two third of them are foreigners.
