     UK's Healthy Nation Program Foiled by Heavy-Drinking,

      LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavy-drinking women, school children who smoke and the overweight of both sexes are ruining Britain's drive to create a healthy nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only 11 of the 27 targets set by the Department of Health to reduce premature death and avoidable sickness by promoting sensible lifestyles look certain to be reached, according to an official report.
     </p>
     <p>
      The National Audit Office today reported limited progress in achieving the aims of the Health of the Nation White Paper of l992.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ambitious strategy to reduce coronary heart disease, strokes, cancer, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases and accidents was introduced by Virginia Bottomley when she was health secretary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Teams from the National Health Service formulated "action plans" to improve education, screening and preventive techniques. Healthy targets were set to be reached by dates between 1994 and 2005.

      But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women, drinking by women and smoking by the young.
     </p>
     <p>
      The British government set targets on obesity because it increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease, strokes and illnesses including diabetes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government wants only 8 percent of women and 6 percent of men, aged 16 to 64, to be overweight by 2005: the same proportion as in 1980. But instead figures since then have risen to 16 percent of women and 13 percent of men.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alcohol targets were set because too much drink raises the blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke, and is blamed for liver cirrhosis, cancers and road traffic accidents.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public to change lifestyles, following government health education.
