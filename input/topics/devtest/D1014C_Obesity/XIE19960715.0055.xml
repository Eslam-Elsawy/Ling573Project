      SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One out of every ten people in Shanghai is overweight, mostly because of improved lifestyles and poor eating habits.
     </p>
     <p>
      A recent survey found that 12.6 percent of 4,895 adults and 11.35 percent of 9,093 children who live in urban Shanghai are obese, and these figures are close to the average weight proportion seen in developed countries, it was reported in today's "Wen Hui Bao Daily."
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University.

     <p>
      People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher than in females, the survey showed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Educational background was also related to the incidence rate, which is lower in well-educated people, especially in females.
     </p>
     <p>
      About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city dwellers, are obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards have greatly improved in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of them gained unwanted pounds because they do not engage in regular exercise, sleep too much and eat food that is high in fat and calories, another survey of Beijing's overweight people showed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Experts warn people who are overweight have increased tendencies toward cardiovascular and cerebral disease, diabetes, and kidney and liver disease.
