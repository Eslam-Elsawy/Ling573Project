     WHO: Diabetics to Top 250 Million by 2025
    </headline>

      GENEVA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetics worldwide will increase from the current about 120 million to top 250 million by the year 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported today.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the U.N. health agency, about 20 percent of diabetics develop the so-called insulin-dependent form of diabetes, or IDDM, and live on with insulin injections, while about 30 percent of the non-IDDM cases may use insulin injections to control their conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The WHO considers insulin an essential drug. However, it noted that in some developing countries, the drug that turns the once fatal IDDM into a treatable disease is still unavailable or unaffordable.

      A vial of insulin may cost a month's salary in many African countries, according to it.
     </p>

      Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the human body's failure to produce insulin or to produce effective insulin. The deficiency leads to increased concentrations of glucose in blood and thus damage the body's many systems, particularly blood vessels and nerves.
     </p>
     <p>
      The long-term complications of diabetes include blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and even gangrene and amputation of the limbs.

      Insulin was discovered in 1921.
