Days of heavy snowfall and an 
ensuing drop in temperatures forced an adult giant panda to hobble
downhill for help at weekend in southwestern Sichuan Province, the
Beijing Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The panda was critically ill and had fallen into a coma when 
she was spotted Sunday morning by a passing driver beside a road 
six km from the famous Wolong giant panda research and 
conservation center, the paper said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda came to after over five hours' infusion and 
oxygen therapy at the center, though she did not stop shivering 
until the room was heated with two electric heaters.
</P>
<P>
"She was fragile and afraid of severe cold," Li Desheng, an 
expert with the center, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 62.5-km giant panda suffers a couple of ailments, including
pneumonia and respiratory problems, and had a temperature below 
the normal range, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Winter is often a hard time for old or weak wildlife. This 
panda's situation was compounded by food shortage, as the fallen 
snow has covered up bamboo groves, the ideal dish for the giant 
pandas.
</P>
<P>
"She isn't out of danger," Li said. "The forestry department 
will decide whether to send her back to the wild depending on her 
physical condition."
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered 
species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous 
regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi 
and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
To protect the animal species, dubbed a "national gem," China 
has set up 33 nature reserves with a combined area of 1.6 million 
hectares.
