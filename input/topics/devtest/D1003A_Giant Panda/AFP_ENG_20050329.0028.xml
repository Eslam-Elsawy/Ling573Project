<P>
China has applied to the United 
Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern 
Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the 
endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The giant pandas are predominantly found in the Wolong, 
Siguniang and Jiajinshan areas of the province, near the cities of 
Chengdu and Yaan.
</P>
<P>
The far western Ganzi and Aba regions of the province that 
border Tibet are also part of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The rarity of the bamboo-chomping bears, along with the variety 
and beauty of the area's landscape and ecology, were cited as 
reasons for the application to the UN, the Shanghai Morning Post 
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan 
home to 76 percent of them, according to the State Forestry 
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The shy animals continue to be under threat from dwindling 
supplies of their main food source and poachers, mining and 
logging.
