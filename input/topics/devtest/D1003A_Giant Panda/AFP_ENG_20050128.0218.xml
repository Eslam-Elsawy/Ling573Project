<P>
China will soon finish building its 
first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in 
studying the endangered animals' blood types and chances of 
accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and 
Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province 
will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Located in the giant panda breeding lab, the bank will help 
researchers answer questions such as how many blood types pandas 
have and whether they reject blood transfusions, centre sources 
said.
</P>
<P>
Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood 
types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack 
sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang 
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The centre will hold a general survey of the blood types of all 
the 81 pandas being kept there, and collect and store their blood to 
better prepare for the protection and rescue of pandas in the wild.
</P>
<P>
To boost their blood, researchers currently give pandas 
injections of glucose and medicine, but blood transfusions are more 
effective in helping the animals improve their immunity and 
accelerate the process of recovery.
</P>
<P>
A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas 
because data on the pandas' blood types and DNA information will be 
readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
China has 163 giant pandas in captivity.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 1,590 of the endangered species living in 
the wild, all in China, though the numbers have risen steadily in 
the past decade after plunging to around 1,100 in the 1980s.
