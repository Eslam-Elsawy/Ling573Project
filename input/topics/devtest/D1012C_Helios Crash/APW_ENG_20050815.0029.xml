Scenic Greek valley turned into inferno of smoke, corpses and debris

GRAMMATIKO, Greece
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blackened bodies, tattered luggage and smoldering debris lay scattered among the
pine trees in a scenic Greek valley after a Helios Airways flight slammed into a
mountainside and filled the air with acrid smoke.
</P>
<P>
Constantinos Michas, a resident of Grammatiko near the ancient city of Marathon,
was one of the first people on the scene Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I took my car and went straight to the mountain ... I saw about 80 dead bodies,
some were children," he said. "There were some body parts but most were just as
their mother made them."
</P>
<P>
Only three parts of the plane remained intact _ the tail, the cockpit, and a
large chunk of the fuselage. The tail, emblazoned with an ancient Greek symbol
of the sun, ended up on a dirt road.
</P>
<P>
The plane _ carrying 121 people, more than a third of them children _ broke up
into at least three pieces.
</P>
<P>
Bodies, luggage and parts of the plane were scattered over 12 acres (5 hectares)
of hillside. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
As police cordoned off part of the crash sites with bright orange tape,
firefighting planes and helicopters swooped overhead to battle a brush fire
started by the crash, which rekindled at the site throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
One eyewitness described the instant the Boeing 737 smashed into the mountain
flanked by two F-16 fighter jets sent to intercept the passenger plane after it
failed to respond to radio signals.
</P>
<P>
"We saw some fighter jets flying very low and after a few minutes we heard a
very loud noise and saw pieces of the plane flying in the air," said Spyros
Papachristou.
</P>
<P>
The pilots of the F-16s said they saw the jet's co-pilot slumped over the
controls and the pilot was not in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
Bits of human flesh, clothing, and luggage were scattered around the wreckage,
which started brush fires around the area.
</P>
<P>
"There is wreckage everywhere," Grammatiko Mayor George Papageorgiou said.
"Things here are very difficult, they are indescribable."
</P>
<P>
As dusk fell, rescue vehicles began ferrying the remains, wrapped in green body
bags, out of the valley and to a fleet of 17 ambulances, which were relaying the
bodies to a morgue in the Athens suburb of Shisto.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on the eve of a main religious holiday in Greece and Cyprus _
a public holiday devoted to the Virgin Mary. A number of black-robed Greek
Orthodox Christian priests were on the scene.
</P>
<P>
Crash scene investigators wearing surgical masks said most bodies appeared to be
intact with some badly burnt.
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus, President Tassos Papadopoulos declared three days of official
mourning. In Greece, Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis returned to Athens from a
holiday on the Aegean island of Tinos.
</P>
<P>
Greece's main opposition leader George Papandreou visited the scene. "This is
extremely difficult work, collecting bodies and putting out these fires. It
appears it was mechanical damage but it's too early to say," he
said.
