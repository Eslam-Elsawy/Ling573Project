      LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Seven people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard.

      The selection process, which began Monday, is going on behind closed doors. Twenty-two of 71 potential jurors have been dismissed.

      Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6. Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold. The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a hospital.

      Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did not participate in Shepard's beating.

      McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death penalty.

      Phil Holt, a 52-year-old Greek literature professor at the University of Wyoming, said he was relieved after being excused from jury selection Thursday.

      ``Laramie's small enough that if you don't know the victim, you at least know people who do,'' he said. ``I know some people who knew Shepard. I know some people close to Henderson's family. It sent shock waves through the town.''

      Opening statements are scheduled for April 6.
