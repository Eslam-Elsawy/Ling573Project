      Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell moved the start of the trial for Russell Arthur Henderson from March 22 to April 6 due to a scheduling conflict involving one of the attorneys.

      Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October. Police have said the attack was motivated in part because he was gay.
