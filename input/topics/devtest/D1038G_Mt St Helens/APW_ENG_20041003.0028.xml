Hazard level upped at Mount St. Helens; hundreds evacuated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens
after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a
powerful tremor. They said the next eruption was imminent or in
progress, and could threaten life and property in the remote area
near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of visitors at the building closest to the volcano _
Johnston Ridge Observatory five miles (eight kilometers) away _ were
asked to leave Saturday. They went quickly to their cars and drove
away, with some relocating several miles (kilometers) north to
Coldwater Ridge Visitors Center, which officials said was safe.
</P>
<P>
The volcano alert of Mount St. Helens was raised to Level 3, which
"indicates we feel an eruption is imminent, or is in progress," said
U.S. Geological Survey geologist Tom Pierson from the observatory. He
said Saturday afternoon that an explosion probably would happen
within the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Pierson said the volcano has released more seismic energy since quake
activity began Sept. 23 than it has at any point since its
devastating May 18, 1980, eruption, which killed 57 people and coated
much of the Northwest with ash. But scientists expect the impending
eruption to be much smaller than the 1980 blast.
</P>
<P>
A day after the volcano spewed a plume of steam and ash thousands of
feet (meters) into the air, there was a very brief steam release
Saturday _ a puff of white cloud, followed by a dust-raising
landslide in the crater. A volcanic tremor signal that came next was
what prompted the heightened alert level.
</P>
<P>
The signal "was far stronger after today's steam eruption" than the
tremor that followed Friday's blast, Steele said. "We were picking it
up throughout western Washington and into central Oregon. Yesterday
we had a very weak tremor signal."
</P>
<P>
A tremor _ a steady vibration _ "indicates movement of gases or fluid
within the volcano," Steele said, while individual earthquakes
indicate "a pounding and breaking of rock."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's tremor lasted about an hour before it was drowned out by a
series of earthquakes _ one or two a minute, with a maximum magnitude
of "well over 2," said Tom Yelin, a USGS seismologist at the UW lab
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday,
said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter)
lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Norton said the chances of an eruption or lava flow have increased,
and that the volcano most likely will see moderate ash eruptions.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest concern at this point is an ash plume and the spread of
ash itself that might come from an explosion," Norton said. "This is
a concern for aircraft travel."
</P>
<P>
The growing consensus among scientists is that new magma is probably
entering the volcano's upper levels, possibly bringing with it
volatile gases that could lead to eruptions, said Bill Steele at the
University of Washington's seismic laboratory in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Explosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly
throwing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news
release. Still, scientists said the evacuation of the observatory was
primarily a precaution in case of heavy ash discharge, which could
make it difficult to drive.
</P>
<P>
"We still feel the risk is confined to this area," Pierson said.
</P>
<P>
No communities are near Mount St. Helens; the closest, Toutle, is 30
miles (48 kilometers) west.
</P>
<P>
Near the town, an impromptu tailgate party was under way along the
shore of Silver Lake, which offers a straight-on view of the mountain
from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of cars lined both sides of State Route 504, their festive
occupants spilled out along the roadside. Folks set up lawn chairs
and cameras on tripods. Radios were tuned to news reports, and a
nearby pizza joint was doing a thriving business.
</P>
<P>
"I missed it the first time back in the '80s eruption and I certainly
wasn't going to this time," said welder Dean Strahm, 48, of Gold Bar,
who brought camping gear and a cooler and planned to stay all night.
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience so I thought I'd come on down."
</P>
<P>
The 1980 blast obliterated the top 1,300 feet (390 meters) of the
volcano, devastated miles (kilometers) of forest and buried the North
Fork of the Toutle River in debris and ash as much as 600 feet (180
meters) deep.
</P>
<P>
The latest seismic activity "probably just reflects the fact that
more rock needs to be broken for magma to reach the surface," said
geologist Dan Dzurisin at the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades
Volcanic Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, about 50 miles (80
kilometers) south.
</P>
<P>
The 1980 eruption reamed open the route to the surface, and for six
years smaller eruptions piled lava into the massive dome that marks
the main conduit for magma. Friday's relatively small eruption, which
generated a plume of ash and smoke 16,000 feet (4,800 meters) high,
was the first since a 1986 dome-building event at the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes may
reflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a
1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggested
at least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion more
likely.
</P>
<P>
Air sampling had detected only tiny amounts of the volcanic gases
that new magma produces, but scientists said the gases could be
sealed inside the system or have been dissolved by water on the
mountain. The volcano holds a 600-foot (180-meter)-deep glacier.
</P>
<P>
Melting of the glacier could trigger debris flows down onto the
barren pumice plain at the foot of the mountain, the USGS said,
noting a "very low probability" that downstream communities would be
affected.
</P>
<P>
Few people live near the mountain, the centerpiece of the Mount St.
Helens National Volcanic Monument in the Gifford Pinchot National
Forest about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Seattle.
