Australian Prime Minister John 
Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion 
Australian dollars (about 764 million US dollars) in loans and 
grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26 
earthquake-tsunami disaster.

This was the biggest single aid package in Australia's history,
Howard told a press conference in Jakarta.

"This is a historic step in Indonesian-Australian relations in 
the wake of this terrible natural disaster," Howard said.

Half of the assistance will be in the form of grants for short 
term relief and the remainder in loans for long term 
reconstruction, Howard said.

The killer tsunami that was touched off by an 8.7-magnitude 
earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra island on Dec. 26, has climbed 
to over 145,000 so far, with over 90,000 deaths reported in 
Indonesia.
