Holst/NYTRNG (with sidebar 2BINGEEATING) Binge eating gets a closer
look New study tests drug that curbs overeaters' urge
</P>
<P>
The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday
season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder,
holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.
</P>
<P>
Binge eating disorder is a newly recognized condition that probably
affects millions of Americans. Those with the disorder frequently eat
large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their
eating.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating
disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2
percent of the population who suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the
University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers
testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat
the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge
eating.
</P>
<P>
Shapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients,
many reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and
even lost weight. A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating
disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a
placebo binged less often and also lost weight.
</P>
<P>
The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge
eaters from around the country, Shapira said. Results are anticipated
next year. It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes
the drug.
</P>
<P>
Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as
indulging in an occasional binge at the table or "grazing" through an
array of buffet offerings.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during
'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner," Shapira said. "The
real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much
more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two
hours.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all
that you are thinking about," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.
As a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until
they are uncomfortably full. Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia
nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio
of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2. It is common in all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Almost all who have this disorder are either overweight or obese. It
has been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss
programs have a binge-eating disorder. They usually develop a weight
problem earlier in life and do not do as well in these programs. One
study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the
members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.
</P>
<P>
The major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases
that accompany obesity. These include diabetes, high blood pressure,
high cholesterol levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease and
certain types of cancer. The causes of the disorder are still
unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have
a history of depression.
</P>
<P>
Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the
National Institutes of Health. Many people report that anger,
sadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a
binge episode.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and
treatable," Shapira said.
</P>
<P>
For those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests
two questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period? Do you
feel out of control as you do so?
</P>
<P>
Those who answer "yes" to both should consider whether they have a
binge-eating disorder.
