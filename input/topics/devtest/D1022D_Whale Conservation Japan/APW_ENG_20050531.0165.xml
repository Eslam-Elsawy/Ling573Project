Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to
appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the
whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
</P>
<P>
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court
last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of
whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a
legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia
because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.
</P>
<P>
However, Allsop granted the animal rights group permission to appeal his
decision to the full bench of the Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
The group's director, Michael Kennedy, said he would appeal the decision within
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"A successful appeal to the full Federal Court could force the government to go
beyond hitting Japan with rhetoric," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Australian government officials have refused to support the group, saying they
will use diplomacy to urge Japan to curb its whaling activities.
</P>
<P>
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986,
but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling
programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
</P>
<P>
Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a
meeting of the IWC that began in Ulsan, South Korea last week. Whaling opponents
fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have a voting majority
at the commission for the first time since the 1986 whaling ban was
imposed.
