<P>
An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company
for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court
to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400
minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
Judge James Allsop based the rejection on a submission to the court by Canberra
saying the government cannot legally stop the whaling company hunting in
international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize
Australia's jurisdiction over the waters.
</P>
<P>
Allsop said the submission, from Australia's Attorney-General Philip Ruddock,
appeared "to have great force" and also expressed concerns that the proposed
legal action could jeopardize "Australia's long term national
interests."
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, HSI director Michael Kennedy told reporters he was "bitterly
disappointed" in the decision and hoped to file an appeal later this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had not taken strong enough steps to stop Japanese
whaling companies from operating in Australian waters.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said the judge had upheld the government's view
that it was not appropriate to pursue the campaign against whaling in the
Australian courts.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to resolve such matters is through bilateral representations and
multilateral fora including the International Whaling Commission," Ruddock said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling
in 1986, but Japan's scientific hunt, in which hundreds of whales are killed
each year, is widely regarded as a way of circumventing the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Japan has said it will push for a widening of its scientific whaling program at
a meeting of the IWC that also began Friday in Ulsan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Whaling opponents fear that pro-whaling countries like Japan and Norway may have
a voting majority at the commission for the first time since the 1986 whaling
ban was imposed.
