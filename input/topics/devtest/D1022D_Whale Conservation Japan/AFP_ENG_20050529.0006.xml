Australian environment minister visits Europe to push 
anti-whaling stance

<P>
Australian Environment Minister Ian 
Campbell set off Sunday on a diplomatic lobbying mission to Europe 
and the Pacific as part of a campaign to undermine Japan's push to 
increase its whale cull.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he would visit key European players in the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) -- including France, 
Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden -- to reinforce Australia's 
anti-whaling position.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also discuss the issue with key Pacific nations 
ahead of an IWC vote at a meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, late next 
month.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is of the clear, informed view that whaling under 
scientific permits should be rejected: it is unnecessary, and 
nothing less than commercial whaling in disguise," Campbell said in 
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We need to work together to promote conservation."
</P>
<P>
Australia last week warned Tokyo it was embarking on an 
unprecedented diplomatic campaign to dissuade Japan from trying to 
escalate its killing of whales.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his 
Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo 
to reconsider its position on whaling.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan's Fisheries Agency responded by saying that 
foreign pressure would not force it into changing its whaling 
policies.
</P>
<P>
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly 
halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, 
but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows 
"scientific research whaling".
</P>
<P>
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for 
permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, 
currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin 
whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation 
Union.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 2,000 tonnes of meat currently obtained from each 
year's cull ends up in supermarkets and restaurants across Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is believed to have the votes needed to get its request 
approved at the Ulsan meeting.
