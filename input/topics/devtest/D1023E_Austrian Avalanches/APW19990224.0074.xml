      WASHINGTON (AP) -- At times tearful, Juanita Broaddrick appeared on NBC's ``Dateline'' tonight describing an alleged sexual assault by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. In the interview, taped Jan. 20 but held by the network until tonight, Mrs. Broaddrick cried briefly as she detailed the alleged assault. She said of Clinton, ``my hatred for him is overwhelming.''

      SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court rejected O.J. Simpson's appeal for custody of his two children today, and he faces a new custody trial that would include evidence on whether he killed their mother.
