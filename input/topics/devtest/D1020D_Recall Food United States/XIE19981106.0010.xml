      WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 250,000 kilograms of ground beef in 33 U.S. states have been recalled because the meat might contain a deadly strain of E. coli.

      The meat-packing giant IBP Inc. disclosed that a sample of beef taken on October 22 from its Dakota City plant could be tainted with E. coli O157:H7, an Associated Press report said.

      Complications associated with the O157:H7 strain can lead to kidney failure, severe anemia, clotting problems and, in some cases, coma and death.

      IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said 71 retail, food service and distribution customers bought the ground beef, sold in vacuum-packaged tubes. The recall does not include any prepackaged fresh or frozen beef patties.

      The meat was under test by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But the company decided Wednesday to recall it.
