      Los Angeles, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company said Wednesday that it was recalling all ground beef it produced on October 22 because it may contain the potentially deadly E.coli O157:H7 bacteria.

      IBP, the world's largest processor of fresh beef, said in a report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.

      Retailers, food service operations and distributors in a total of 33 states have been identified as having received the ground beef, said the company, adding that much of it is believed to have been consumed already.

      But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef produced on that day and the company said it had notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which was testing the product.

      Earlier this year, IBP recalled a shipment of 282,129 pounds of beef after a sample was found to be tainted by the same bacteria.

      Researchers said E.coli O157:H7 accounts for more than 20,000 infections and 200 deaths annually in the United States.
