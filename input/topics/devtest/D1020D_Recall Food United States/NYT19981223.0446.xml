     OUTBREAK OF FOOD POISONING LEADS TO WARNING ON HOT DOGS AND COLD CUTS
    </headline>
    (th) By JO THOMAS c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

     <p>
      Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and cold cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States. Bil Mar is a division of Sara Lee Corp.

      The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat. It thrives in refrigerators, but can be destroyed by boiling or reheating food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
     </p>
     <p>
      When ingested, Listeria bacteria can cause illness and death among the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened immune systems. In a normal year, an estimated 1,850 people become seriously ill. Of these, 425 die.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three who have died in this outbreak have been elderly. They are a man, 79, from the Rochester, N.Y., area, and two others from Ohio, one from Toledo and one from Cincinnati. The fourth victim, from the Toledo area, was a fetus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ohio has had the largest number of cases, 13. New York has had 12. Tennessee, Massachusetts and West Virginia have each had 3. Michigan has had two cases. Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and Georgia have had one each. The outbreak began on Aug. 2.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dr. Elizabeth Koch, acting state epidemiologist in Ohio, said the DNA of the bacteria involved in the outbreak showed ``a very rare pattern,'' called Pattern E.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seeking the source, health officials from New York, Connecticut, Ohio and Tennessee worked with the agency to examine the diets of affected patients. Most had eaten cooked hot dogs the month before they became ill.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, said that on Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators isolated this strain of Listeria on an open package of hot dogs that a month earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill. It is not known how or where this package was contaminated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products might contain the Listeria bacteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      The products recalled were only those labeled with Establishment Numbers EST P261 or EST 6911 for Ball Park, Bil Mar, Bryan Bunsize, and Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack hot dogs, and Grillmaster, Hygrade, Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We have stopped operations for those product lines at the plant,'' Theresa Herlevsen, a spokeswoman for Sara Lee, said in a telephone interview, emphasizing that there had been no conclusive information about contamination of these products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ms. Herlevesen said Sara Lee estimated the cost of the recall at $50 million to $70 million. Consumers may return the recalled products to the place of purchase for a full refund.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We want to commend the company for taking this step,'' said Skinner of the disease control agency, noting that the company was cooperating with federal investigators. ``What's important is that people at risk, such as the elderly and pregnant women, need to reduce their risk by avoiding these products or thoroughly cooking them before eating them.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``If you thoroughly cook your hot dogs,'' Skinner said, ``you kill the Listeria. We don't want people to stop eating hot dogs and cold cut meats.''
     </p>
     <p>
      The investigation into the source and cause of the outbreak was continuing, he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The disease control agency said healthy adults and children were occasionally infected with Listeria, but rarely became seriously ill. People with weakened immune systems, including those with cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, are much more vulnerable. People with AIDS are almost 300 times more likely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      Symptoms are those of a flu-like illness, and may include a fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea or a stiff neck. A blood test is the most reliable way to diagnose the disease.
     </p>
     <p>
      To reduce the risks, the disease centers, recommends thoroughly cooking raw food from animal sources, washing raw vegetables, and keeping uncooked meats separate from vegetables. Hands, knives and cutting boards should be washed after coming into contact with uncooked foods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the risk of listeriosis associated with foods from deli counters is relatively low, the disease agency says pregnant women and immunosuppressed people may choose to avoid these foods or thoroughly reheat cold cuts before eating. They should also avoid soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined and Mexican-style cheese.
