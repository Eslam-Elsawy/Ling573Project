<TEXT>
<P>
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River
on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick 
of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast 
China's Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
The discharging move was made with the approval by the State 
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Fengman Hydropower Station in the upper reach of Songhua 
River increased the daily discharge amount from 600 cubic meters 
per second to 1,000 cubic meters per second starting from 10:00 
a.m. Thursday. The flow is expected to return to 600 cubic meters 
per second in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nierji Hydropower Station on the river also 
enlarged the discharging flow from 20 cubic meters per second to 
120 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged water current would not only help dilute pollution
in the river, but also slowed down freezing of the river water 
downstream.
</P>
<P>
The toxic contents in the water are declining gradually after 
days of sedimentation, experts said, citing water monitoring 
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Harbin, which is under a 4-day water supply cut-off, has taken 
measures to ensure public safety and a safe drinking water supply.
