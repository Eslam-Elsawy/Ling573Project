China focus: China pledges to minimize impact of river pollution on
Russia

BEIJING, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- China pledged on Thursday it will 
try its utmost to minimize the impact of northeast China's Songhua
River pollution on the neighboring Russia, including intensifying 
monitoring and water quality control measures.
</P>
<P>
"China is very concerned about the possible hazards to Russia 
and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said at a press 
conference. "Both have pledged to cooperate closely to handle the 
pollution."
</P>
<P>
At another press conference Thursday, a senior official with 
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said 
the Chinese side will keep informing the Russian side of what it 
has learnt from our monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are making specific arrangements for opening a 
hotline for the matter," said Zhang Lijun, deputy director of 
SEPA.
</P>
<P>
He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached
Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is 
expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur 
River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days 
judging from the current flow speed.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that around 100 tons of pollutants containing 
benzene has flown into the Songhua River, caused by a Nov. 13 
explosion at an upstream chemical plant of the Jilin Petrochemical
Company under the China National Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking
from the river for various periods. Harbin, a city of more than 3 
million residents, stops drawing water from the Songhua River for 
four days starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said as the polluted water flows downstream, the density
of pollutants has markedly subsided. Some has deposited and some 
has been absorbed along the way.
</P>
<P>
The pollutants, stretching around 80 kilometers long, will be 
further diluted after they pass Harbin in around 40 hours as 
several major tributaries are to join the Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
The content of nitrobenzene in the polluted water exceeded the 
national safe standard by 29.9 times and that of benzene 2.6 times
when it passed Zhaoyuan from Nov. 20 to 22. When the polluted 
water flowed further downstream, the content of nitrobenzene was 
reduced further to only about 10.7 times of above the national 
standard and that of benzene 0.08 times of the national standard, 
he said.
</P>
<P>
Measures already taken by the local governments include 
blocking the entry of pollutants, discharging more water from two 
reservoirs to dilute the pollutants, organizing experts to study 
control measures and enhancing monitoring work, part of the 
environmental emergency response mechanism activated shortly after
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have shown keen concern over the incident. 
Premier Wen Jiabao has ordered the environmental department and 
regional governments to take effective measures to guarantee the 
safety of potable water, beefing up monitoring work and providing 
accurate information.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has dispatched an expert group, headed by 
director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision 
and Administration Li Yizhong, to Harbin to handle the accident.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies and active carbon used to purify water are being
shipped continuously to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
As the public has been informed timely, no human being has been
harmed, said the SEPA official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the government will step up crackdown on polluting 
enterprises, noting 2,682 polluting plants have been shut down 
from May last year to September this year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the State Council set a target of combating 
environmental degradation for the next 15 years. By 2020, China's 
environmental quality and ecological status should be improved 
remarkably, according to the plan.
