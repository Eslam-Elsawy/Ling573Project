England Pleads Guilty to Abu Ghraib Charges

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the young Army
reservist whose grinning, thumbs-up image came to symbolize the worst
of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, told a military judge Monday that
she knew the detainee abuses were wrong but went along because of peer
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Offering the most ordinary explanation to a scandal that ignited
international outrage, England said she posed in some of the widely
circulated photographs showing humiliating abuses of Iraqi detainees
to placate her then-boyfriend and others from her Maryland-based unit.
</P>
<P>
``I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,''
England, 22, said in a glum voice as she pleaded guilty to mistreating
detainees at the notorious Baghdad prison. ``They were being very
persistent and bugging me, and I was like, OK, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
England became one of the most visible and polarizing figures in
the prison abuse scandal when the notorious photographs of naked and
hooded Iraqi detainees enduring abuses at the hands of U.S. soldiers
became public a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot, 1-inch soldier with the pixie haircut was shown
flashing a thumbs-up behind a pyramid of naked prisoners in one
photograph. In another, she has a cigarette clenched in her teeth as
she grins and points at the genitals of a naked detainee. In one of
the most vivid pictures from the scandal, England is shown holding a
leather leash tied around the neck of a prisoner lying on the
cellblock floor.
</P>
<P>
Those photographs stood in stark contrast to the image of England
when she returned to the United States early last year, pregnant
(reportedly by the scandal's reputed ringleader, Charles Graner) and
facing more than three decades in a military prison for her role in
the abuses.
</P>
<P>
Closing the last high-profile case in the scandal, England pleaded
guilty Monday to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of mistreating
detainees and one count of dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
England, who gave birth to a son in October, now faces a maximum
sentence of 11 years in military prison. But she is expected to face
considerably less time than that under the undisclosed terms of her
plea deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
A jury composed of Army officers and enlisted soldiers will be
seated Tuesday morning to recommend a sentence for England as part of
a penalty hearing expected to last several days. Under military law,
she would receive the lesser punishment between what the jury
recommends and what prosecutors have offered.
</P>
<P>
England was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police
Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu
Ghraib. Four other members of the 372nd and two low-level military
intelligence officers have entered guilty pleas in the abuse scandal
and received sentences ranging from no time to 8 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
Spc. Sabrina Harman, a former Abu Ghraib guard, is scheduled to go
to trial at Fort Hood next week.
</P>
<P>
Graner is so far the only soldier charged in the scandal to contest
the case against him at a military trial. He was convicted of every
charge at a trial here in January and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Graner was back at the court building at Fort Hood, called
as a possible witness for England in the penalty phase of her
proceedings. England's attorneys are expected to argue as part of
their mitigating case that England was led astray by Graner, whom she
frequently sneaked out at night to visit at the prison's cellblock.
</P>
<P>
The two no longer are romantically involved. After his conviction,
Graner married fellow soldier and former co-defendant Megan Ambuhl; he
is serving his sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
Under questioning Monday from Col. James L. Pohl, a military judge,
England repeatedly said that she agreed at Graner's suggestion to
appear in the photographs that outraged much of the Arab world and
opened an embarrassing chapter in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
When Pohl asked about the photograph showing England holding a
detainee by a leash, she said it was Graner's idea: ``I assumed it was
OK, because he was an MP. He had the background as a corrections
officer, and, him being older than me, I thought he knew what he was
doing.''
</P>
<P>
England said she knew it was wrong when Graner pulled out his
digital camera and started taking pictures of the episode ``for his
own amusement.''
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys are expected to present evidence over the next
few days that England has long suffered from mental problems and
learning disabilities and was extremely susceptible to the influence
of her peers.
</P>
<P>
In court, England frequently appeared hesitant and unsure of her
answers as Pohl asked whether she knew other various actions were
wrong at the time she committed them -- a key legal test in
determining whether a plea in military court can be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The judge spent nearly three hours going over with England the
details of an 11-page statement of facts that England acknowledged in
her plea deal.
</P>
<P>
``If you knew it was wrong, then why did you do it?'' Pohl asked
again and again during the hearing. Referring to Graner, England
repeatedly answered: ``He asked me to.''
</P>
<P>
``Did you get any amusement out of it?'' Pohl asked at one point.
</P>
<P>
``Not really,'' England said after a long pause. ``But I did what
they wanted me to.''
