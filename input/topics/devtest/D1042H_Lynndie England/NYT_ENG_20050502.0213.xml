PRISONERS ABUSED FOR 'AMUSEMENT'; ENGLAND PLEADS GUILTY, SAYING SHE 'CHOSE' TO DEGRADE IRAQI DETAINEES AT ABU GHRAIB

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A clique of U.S. soldiers tormented Iraqi
detainees at Abu Ghraib prison for "amusement," not for any
authorized military mission, Pfc. Lynndie England testified Monday as she
pleaded guilty to seven abuse-related charges.
</P>
<P>
"I had a choice, but I chose to do what my
friends wanted me to," the 22-year-old reservist said at her
court-martial. "I was just yielding to peer pressure."
</P>
<P>
A jury of U.S. Army troops will be selected today to
set punishment, which could be a sentence from two to
11 years for conspiracy, indecency and maltreatment of detainees.
</P>
<P>
England became the eighth enlisted soldier to be found guilty of
2003 Abu Ghraib crimes that continue to taint the reputations
of the United States and its military. The most severe
punishment was set at 10 years for Pvt. Charles Graner,
who orchestrated many of the abuses and will be called
as a witness for England.
</P>
<P>
She and Graner, both from the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company,
were romantically involved while in Iraq. England gave birth to
his son in October, months after they broke up. Last
month, the imprisoned Graner was married by proxy to co-defendant
Megan Ambuhl.
</P>
<P>
Graner is crucial to England's claim that she followed his lead
at Abu Ghraib, where he was a guard and she
was a clerk.
</P>
<P>
Before accepting her guilty pleas, the judge, Col. James Pohl, required
England to clearly describe her wrongdoing and motives. Asked if
she had been ordered by her chain of command to
mistreat inmates, England replied, "No, sir."
</P>
<P>
Queried how she knew it was wrong to pose in a
photo with nude inmates being forced to masturbate, England said:
"Anybody could be offended seeing that picture."
</P>
<P>
The interrogation produced repeated statements by England that soldiers abused Iraqis
"for their own amusement," and admissions that she participated "because
they asked me to."
</P>
<P>
But she also confirmed to the judge's satisfaction that she knew
it was wrong to engage in the abuses, regardless of
the fact that Graner and another abusive soldier had backgrounds
as civilian prison guards.
</P>
<P>
Explaining perhaps the most notorious photo in which she appeared, England
said the main reason she held an Iraqi on a
leash was because Graner told her to. Graner had said
he wanted to photograph the 5-foot-1 England controlling the nude
Iraqi to instill fear in other inmates, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
"He wanted it to look more degrading and humiliating, with a
female of my size," she said. But she quickly realized
Graner's explanation that he needed to abuse the detainees in
order to "control" them was not true.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was not only morally wrong but legally wrong,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
England also conceded that during most of her misdeeds, she was
visiting Graner and other friends from her company, but wasn't
always on official business in the maximum security wing where
they worked.
</P>
<P>
England also backed off from earlier assertions that the tormenting of
detainees was part of an effort to soften them up
for intelligence agents. Although guards were told to deprive detainees
of sleep, manipulate their meal schedules and force them to
maintain awkward positions to cause stress, England said, "no, sir,"
when asked if any of her crimes were done to
help interrogators.
</P>
<P>
Officers and enlisted soldiers who will set England's punishment are expected
to hear testimony from several defense witnesses, including psychology and
sociology experts, as well as Graner.
</P>
<P>
In a sentencing hearing likely to last several days, jurors also
could hear a prosecution witness who is expected to describe
England's job performance while in Iraq, which included admonishments for
her affair with Graner.
