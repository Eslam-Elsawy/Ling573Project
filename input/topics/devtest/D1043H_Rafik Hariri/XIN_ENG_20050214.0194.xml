Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 
on Monday condemned a blast which killed former Lebanese Prime 
Minister Rafik Hariri as "horrible terrorist act," the official 
SANA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Assad condemned the horrible terrorist act that claimed lives 
of a number of Lebanese people, notably former Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri," SANA said.
</P>
<P>
"Syria as a government and people announces support to sisterly 
Lebanon during those dangerous situations and offers condolences to
Mr. Rafik Hariri and other victims' families," Assad was quoted as 
saying.
</P>
<P>
Assad, whose country still maintains about 14,000 troops in 
Lebanon, called on the Lebanese to maintain national unity against 
those who seek to arouse disputes and partition in the country, 
SANA added.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been under international pressure to withdraw its 
troops from Lebanon and not to interfere in Lebanon's internal 
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in
the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

<P>
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October. He came to 
office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years.
