Groups of rare aboriginal tribes already near the edge of extinction
in the Andaman and Nicobar islands survived a massive tsunami, the
coast guard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five tribes numbering 989 people were safe after Sunday's onslaught,
including the 100-member Onge, 250 of the fiercely independent
Sentinelese, 39 of the almost extinct Andamanese, 350 of the Jarawa
and 250 of the hunter-gatherer Shompen.
</P>
<P>
They were located by helicopter and some were reached by boat and
provided with supplies and medical treatment, Coast Guard director
general Arun Kumar Singh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian navy had been hunting for the aborigines on the
tsunami-savaged Nicobar islands amid fears that any harm to some of
nature's most enigmatic communities could push them into extinction.
</P>
<P>
The mangrove islet of Campbell Bay is one of hundreds in the
archipelago, some partly or fully reserved for aborigines.
</P>
<P>
"The great Andamanese tribes are all OK," Lt. Governor Ram Kapse told
reporters. "There are no casualties among them."
</P>
<P>
The Shompen live along riverbanks in the dense mangroves surrounding
the settlement of Campbell Bay, 800 kilometres (500 miles) south of
the Andamanese capital Port Blair.
</P>
<P>
For centuries they have shied away from outside contact, notably with
Indians.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the island chain bore the full brunt of the massive waves
triggered by a huge undersea earthquake off nearby Sumatra,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government in the mid-1970s sent retired military
personnel as settlers to the breathtaking tropical territory amid
friction with neighbouring Indonesia over ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Onge tribe was confined to 25 square kilometers after the Forest
Department took over their land in 1977 and face further loss of
territory as the government builds homes, roads, jetties and a match
factory near their reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Sentinelese on North Sentinel island have constantly repulsed
outsiders with showers of arrows and remain one of the least studied
of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
The Andamanese, on the verge of extinction, were decimated by disease
from colonisers in the mid-19th century and remain settled on tiny
Strait Island.
</P>
<P>
The once reclusive and hostile Jawara occupy 639 square kilometers on
the south and middle Andaman islands. But in recent years they have
been steadily engaging with tourists since a road split their land.
</P>
<P>
One other tribe numbering 30,000, the Nicobarese, are not decreasing
and have been partly assimilated into Indian society.
</P>
<P>
The origins of the endangered Andaman tribes, today only about 12
percent of the overall population of some 350,000, still mystify
anthropologists.
</P>
<P>
Genetic evidence suggests the pygmy-like people with dark skin and
tightly curled hair have lived on the Andamans for at least 60,000
years.
</P>
<P>
"They are very important -- a link to our roots we come from, to our
prehistoric days when we were at the hunting and gathering stage,"
Ajoy Bagchi, executive director of the New Delhi-based
Anthropological Survey of India said.
