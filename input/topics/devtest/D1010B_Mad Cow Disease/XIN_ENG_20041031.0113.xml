<P>
Canada, whose exports of beef products are effected by a single case
of  mad cow disease since may 2003, has exceeded its mad cow testing
target for 2004, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the
agency said in a news release. The target was 8,000 cattle tested by
the end of 2004. All results came back negative for the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching this year's target ahead of schedule shows that Canada is
taking its surveillance responsibilities seriously," Agriculture
Minister Andy Mitchell said in the release.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is increasing the number of cattle tested to
30,000 in 2005 and subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
The testing process is aimed at high-risk cattle that are showing
signs of disease, such as aged or downer animals.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted
testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in
Alberta in May 2003. The United States and many other countries
imposed bans on Canadian beef after the discovery.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated the mad cow crisis has cost the Canadian beef
industry and rural economies about 5 billion US dollars.
