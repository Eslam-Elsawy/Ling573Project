A 48-month-old cow that died recently has been confirmed as having
had mad cow disease, making it the 14th case in Japan, the country's
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cow was born in Shikaoi, north Japan's Hokkaido region, in
October 2000, and was checked for mad cow disease after it died, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow
that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan National Institution of Infectious Disease confirmed the
infection after conducting detailed checks on samples from the cow,
which tested positive Monday in an initial examination.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a blanket BSE test on all slaughtered cattle, local
authorities in Japan in April began conducting checks on all cows
aged 24 months or older that died of natural or unknown causes.
