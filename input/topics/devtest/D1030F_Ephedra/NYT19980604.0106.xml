     TEXAS CONSIDERS REGULATING PRODUCT USED IN POPULAR HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS

      AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to boost his daily workouts at the gym, Jeff Bowers turned recently to a popular herbal supplement to increase his metabolism.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bowers bought the ephedrine-based product, Ripped Fuel, at a health food store in San Antonio. But after only a few days of using it as directed to try and heighten athletic performance and burn fat, Bowers suffered an attack.
     </p>

      ``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I took the Ripped Fuel with me, and before I even opened it up, the nurse guessed what it was,'' he said. ``She said I wasn't the first whom she'd seen with the problem.''
     </p>
     <p>
      After receiving more than 1,400 similar, ephedrine-related complaints from people across the state, the Texas Department of Health is considering classifying the stimulant as a dangerous drug and requiring a prescription for most products containing it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banning ephedrine from over-the-counter sales would affect the multimillion-dollar, herbal-supplement industry in Texas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of its products include diet aids, athletic performance-boosters and many ``herbal ecstasy'' intoxicants that teen-agers buy at convenience stores to get an amphetamine-like ``buzz'' or ``high.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of non-prescription ephedrine products sold for asthma, such as Primatene and some nasal decongestants, would not fall under the proposed new regulations, officials said.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least eight deaths in Texas and more than 40 nationwide have been linked to ephedrine _ a stimulant found in certain Asian plants _ said Cynthia Culmo of the state health department.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``To say you can determine a safe amount (for over-the-counter sale) is incorrect,'' Culmo said. ``The only amount we see as safe is zero.''
     </p>
     <p>
      A Department of Health committee met Wednesday to accept public comment on the regulation change. More than 150 people testified at the hearing, with an overwhelming majority against requiring prescription sales of ephedrine.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most who testified were connected to the industry that provides ephedrine-based dietary supplements or stimulants. The witnesses pleaded with the state to back down from the proposal and instead consider a compromise that, among other things, would restrict sales of ephedrine-based products to minors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Health is not expected to rule on the possible changes until this fall.

      Banning over-the-counter sales of ephedrine would only hurt consumers and independent business distributors, while allowing larger drug companies to profit, said Phillip Sindler of the Dallas-based Wellness International Network, which sells dietary supplements, including the stimulant.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It's not a health issue. It's an issue of where is the profit going to go,'' Sindler told the committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than 60 companies in the Texas market ephedrine-based products, which constitute a multimillion industry in the state, according to Michael Ellis, president of Metabolife International.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although other states have restricted some sales of ephedrine products, Texas' proposal is by far the most far-reaching, Ellis said.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``This shocked us,'' he said, stressing that there is no medical evidence that ephedrine products cause adverse effects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ellis and Dr. Ted Farber, a toxicologist for the dietary supplement industry, disputed the number of complaints and deaths Culmo said were possibly linked to ephedrine products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Food and Drug Administration originally had reported it was investigating more than 40 deaths possibly related to ephedrine, Farber said. But recently, the federal agency revised that number to only two, he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      An FDA spokeswoman did not respond to a request for the correct number.
     </p>
     <p>
      The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine per dose. The agency also is looking at requiring product labels that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven days.
     </p>
     <p>
      As evidence ephedrine is safe, Ellis cited an ongoing study by Dr. Patricia Daly of the Harvard Medical School on the effects of a supplement containing caffeine and ephedra, an herb from which ephedrine is extracted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The incomplete study, paid for by companies that market ephedrine products, has found no adverse effects so far on patients, Daly said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The death about two months ago of a 15-year-old California girl who was taking an ephedrine-based stimulant also has highlighted the ongoing debate over the safety of such products. Rosanna Porras reportedly took Ripped Fuel capsules before collapsing at soccer practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      She later died, and California officials are still investigating the possibility that the herbal supplement caused her death. The company that markets Ripped Fuel, Twinlaboratories Inc. in New York, has said it does not believe its product was responsible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bowers supports the move to ban such products from over-the-counter sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Sure, I'll admit that part of it's because of my own ignorance for trusting some 18-year-old who recommended the stuff at the health food store,'' he said. ``But these companies are duping people because they stand to make a lot of money, while this stuff is killing people.''
