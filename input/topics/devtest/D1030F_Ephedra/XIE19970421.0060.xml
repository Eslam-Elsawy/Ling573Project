     China Starts Massive Campaign against Narcotic Crimes

      BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will carry out a massive targeted fight against narcotics-related crimes from this month through the end of September, to curb rampant drug smuggling and the increase of drug use.
     </p>
     <p>
      The campaign was outlined at a national anti-drug conference late last month, and announced today by the National Committee of Narcotics Control (NCNC).
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the NCNC, the Chinese authorities have attached great importance to the drug problem since it re-emerged in the country in the early 1980s, and have launched a series of offensives against drug-related crimes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Influenced by worsening international drug crimes, China is now confronted with an unprecedented situation: 520,000 drug users across the country had been registered with government medical institutions by the end of 1995.
     </p>
     <p>
      But some local authorities have not fully recognized the seriousness of the problem, and have not done enough to crack down on drug-related crime, the NCNC said.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was discovered that some grassroots level authorities have privately given the green light to drug growers, which has stimulated the spread of drug production and use.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NCNC demanded party and government bodies at all levels concentrate on the problems of drug use, planting and trafficking.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tight control should be exercised in regions that produce natural ephedra, which is used to make methamphetamine, or "ice," and all illegal dealings in the substance should be eliminated, the NCNC said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Departments concerned must avoid wranglings over duties and responsibilities and coordinate with each other, it was urged.
     </p>
     <p>
      More importantly, the NCNC said, criminals involved in drug-related activities must be dealt with strictly in accordance with law, and fines should never be levied in place of harsher punishment.
     </p>
     <p>
      It also encouraged public trials to be held for the offenders in order to educate the public and deter crime, and to mobilize the public to actively participate in the anti-drug drive, according to the NCNC.
     </p>
     <p>
      The NCNC set up a general headquarters today for the campaign and published a hotline number, 65204111, to take reports and opinions and offer legal advice.
