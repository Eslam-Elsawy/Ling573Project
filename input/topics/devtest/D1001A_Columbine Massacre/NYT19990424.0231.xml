    `Please comfort this town' By Rachel Sauer c.1999 Cox News Service
    <text>
     <p>
      LITTLETON, Colo. _ Lynda Pasma and Kerry Herurlin stopped halfway down Mt. Columbine on Saturday morning to pray.
     </p>
     <p>
      The women, both mothers of two young children, bowed their heads, closed their eyes and whispered, ``Oh, God please bless the families who lost children,'' and they began to cry. ``Please comfort them and be with them,
     </p>
     <p>
      and comfort the people of this town. Please comfort this town.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Littleton needs comfort.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs. The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Littleton needs comfort.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt. Columbine, a hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball fields. The first few visitors climbed over slushy snow that melted quickly as the sun finally made an appearance after three days of snow.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the day progressed, the snow became thick mud and as many as 100 visitors at a time came to the top of the hill to look at the rough wood cross that had been staked into the ground there. They bent to leave flowers, poems, balloons and other mementos of grief at the base of the cross, then stood to gaze at the familiar town that seemed to look different after such a loss.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of Littleton is visible from the top of Mt. Columbine _ the rows of roofs, the sidewalks, the strip malls and trash cans, the basketball backstops above garage doors. Physically, it's the same town it was Monday.
     </p>
     <p>
      But 15 of its own are gone, and the loss resonates deeply and profoundly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many wonder what to do now. How do people experiencing grief and anger and confusion and intense sadness navigate the unfamiliar paths to peace?
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I don't know,'' said Debbie Ellwanger, a 10-year Littleton resident. ``Nobody knows where to go from here. I think we have to learn from this and not let those kids die in vain.''
     </p>
     <p>
      She and her husband, Larry, trekked through the dirty snow up Mt. Columbine on Saturday, fingers laced together as they cried for the children.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``They shouldn't have died,'' Larry Ellwanger said. His wife nodded: No, they shouldn't have died.
     </p>
     <p>
      So they came to the wood cross on top of Mt. Columbine to try making sense of something that never will. Below the hill, in the middle of the baseball field, someone had built 13 small snowmen in an even circle. Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and possibly never will.
     </p>
     <p>
      On top of Mt. Columbine, though, people thought more about healing and pulling together and getting through.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``All we can do is come together,'' said Carrie Goertz, 16. ``It's just something that all the barriers have been broken and people have to accept and take care of each other. There's always going to be differences between
     </p>
     <p>
      people, but we've got to look past that, the exterior stuff, and just be together, be unified.''
     </p>
     <p>
      ``And we've got to take advantage of our time with our family and friends,'' Aimee Jensen, 18, added quietly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tragedy at Columbine has brought unity that for now is unbreakable _ it has reached around the world and drawn in the thoughts and prayers of people far removed from suburban Colorado. The memorials in Clement Park testify to the depth of grief that those who didn't lose loved ones in the massacre feel.
     </p>
     <p>
      They bring cards and flowers, donate food and building materials, thinking about how impossibly sad it is when people _ particularly children _ die without reason, about what they would have done if it had happened to someone they love, about the people suffering most.
     </p>
     <p>
      One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial sign and said: ``Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better.''
     </p>
     <p>
      The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight: guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth, community togetherness, peace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hopefully they are issues that will not be forgotten when time passes. But for now, for the next several weeks, people seem able only to get through the worst of it, to handle the realization that some people are not coming
     </p>
     <p>
      back and that yes, things like this do happen here.
     </p>
     <p>
      And that somehow, life keeps moving.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``That's the strange things,'' said Aaron Burningham, 27, looking out across Littleton from the top of Mt. Columbine. ``It seems like life should stop, but it doesn't.''
