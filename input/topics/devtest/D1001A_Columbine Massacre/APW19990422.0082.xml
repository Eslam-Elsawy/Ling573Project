      LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls. Jittery staff and students walked past armed guards and cried and hugged inside.

      At one point, two bomb squad trucks sped to the school after a backpack scare. Dozens of students streamed out of the school hours early, unable to stand the tension any longer.

      ``It's like a prison in there,'' said Jessica Miller, 15.

      ``You can't even go to the bathroom without permission, and then they time you,'' said Holly Bernside, also 15. ``All the teachers are wearing nametags, and there is one at every door.''

      The school's marquee proclaimed ``Rebels our thoughts are with you.'' Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded. Columbine is about three miles away.

      Armed deputies stood guard at the only entrance and students needed their parents' permission to leave.

      Students leaving the school said the intense security inside scared them.

      ``It's very uncomfortable in there. There are a lot of people crying,'' said Tyler Herbert, 16, a sophomore.

      Rumors quickly spread, these days fueled on the Internet as well as by phone, that ``Chatfield would be next,'' said Ms. Miller, a sophomore. Parents drove up and asked a reporter if it was true that a student was barricaded inside a classroom. It wasn't.

      Students were forbidden to leave their backpacks lying around. Some of the bombs used in the assault at Columbine were planted in knapsacks.

      The principal came onto Chatfield's public address system and urged students to wear ``more moderate clothes both in school and when you go out,'' Ms. Bernside said. The killers at Columbine wore black trench coats.

      The arrival of two bomb squad trucks with sirens blaring further shook those inside. The bomb squad was called because a backpack had been found unattended in a hallway. It contained books.

      A pizza delivery followed. The school wanted to make sure there was enough to eat since students couldn't leave campus for lunch and get back in.

      Diane Hitchingham of the Jefferson County school system said schools were getting phony bomb threats. School officials kept reporters out of Chatfield and other Jefferson County schools.

      Ms. Bernside, a sophomore, said all the efforts to counsel students and banners in the school lamenting the deaths made things worse.

      Joe Murphy, a 16-year-old sophomore, said that anyone with a free hour was required to go to the school's commons.

      Herbert interjected: ``I'm a little worried about putting all the kids in one place. If someone wanted to come and start shooting again it would be real easy for them.''
     </p>
     <p>
      A couple of hours after Chatfield opened, Nancy Hoag decided to pull her daughter, Melissa, 15, out. ``I was a little nervous about her going back and it is scary in there,'' she said, her voice choking.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We have friends whose children go to Columbine,'' Mrs. Hoag said. ``They were lucky, but why do you have to be lucky?''
     </p>
     <p>
      Herbert said he had to leave because ``I needed a smoke. I went three hours without one.''
     </p>

      Barbara Monsu, who oversees the county's high schools, said more students than expected had come to class. Chatfield has 1,870 students. She said the school was allowing students to stay home.
     </p>

      ``But the kids want to be here,'' she said. ``They need to be here.''
