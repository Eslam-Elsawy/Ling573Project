    Floyd lashes out toward Southeast keeps watch By Sanjay Bhatt and Larry Hobbs c.1999 Cox News Service
    <text>
     <p>
      WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Floyd got stronger and headed toward the Bahamas Saturday, packing 110 mph winds and leaving weather pundits wondering whether it will hit South Florida this week.
     </p>
     <p>
      Water managers and county emergency workers were on alert, while some anxious people in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast stocked up on storm supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``It's going to be a strong hurricane,'' said meteorologist Edwin Campos. ``The whole thing is where it's going to go.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Floyd whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands on Saturday, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding. The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.
     </p>
     <p>
      At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 mph.
     </p>
     <p>
      While forecasters say they can't predict where Floyd will go after Tuesday, they said Floyd's center could reach the East Coast by Thursday at its current speed. Residents could experience its wind and rain much sooner. Tropical-force winds extend 175 miles from the center, while hurricane gales reach out 105 miles, the hurricane center said.
     </p>

      If the hurricane keeps on the predicted course, a citizen's information line could be activated as early as today, said Bill O'Brien, Palm Beach County's emergency management director.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We're doing the same thing as everyone else: We're watching it,'' O'Brien said.
     </p>

      The American Red Cross is ready to open 11 shelters in Palm Beach County, including one for people who need breathing equipment, he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, there have been no special water releases from canals, said Ann Overton, a spokeswoman for the South Florida Water Management District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The district's two meteorologists were working staggered shifts this weekend to watch the storm, she said.

      Area grocery stores reported a small run on nonperishables, but grocery managers are anticipating a crush on such items in the next couple of days.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``Oh, yeah, it's happening already _ started this morning,'' said Fred Price, manager of the Publix on Village Boulevard in West Palm Beach.
     </p>
     <p>
      The store sold 550 1-gallon water jugs Saturday. ``If it keeps coming like it is now, we'll get hit hard,'' Price said. ``It will be outrageous.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Gary Line, manager of a Winn-Dixie in Stuart, plans to order extra nonperishables today after a run Saturday.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``For a couple of hours it was pretty wild in here today,'' he said. ``We'll order heavy on those items tomorrow, because the next truck won't come until Tuesday and if it's coming it'll be in full swing by then.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Hardware stores were ordering more hurricane supplies as a precaution.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We've had several calls today asking about plywood, anchor screw and other items, asking if we had any readily available,'' said Donald Chamberlain, a salesman at the Home Depot on Lake Worth Road. ``But there's been no real noticeable rush yet.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Boca Raton's residents may be less concerned. ``We haven't gotten any calls at all today,'' a Home Depot employee there said. ``No one's really thinking ahead.''
