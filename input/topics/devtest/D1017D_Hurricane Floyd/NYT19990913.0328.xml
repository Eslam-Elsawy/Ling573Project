    Floyd's direction keeps coastal Georgians on edge By Jingle Davis c. 1999 Cox News Service
    <text>
     <p>
      BRUNSWICK, Ga._A voluntary evacuation of heavily-populated barrier islands and low-lying areas east of Ga. 17 could become mandatory by noon today as Hurricane Floyd showed signs of swinging closer to coastal Georgia.
     </p>
     <p>
      A hurricane warning was issued north to Brunswick late Monday afternoon and a watch was extended as far up the coast as Savannah.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``This is the most serious threat to coastal Georgia and the whole east coast since Hurricane Hugo in 1989,'' said Ed Abel, chief of Glynn County's emergency management agency. ``We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Floyd, already a major Category 4 storm with 155 mile an hour sustained winds and gusts of up to 190 miles an hour, would be upgraded to a Category 5 storm if its winds increase to 156 miles an hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both Glynn and Chatham counties called for voluntary evacuations of the most vulnerable stretches of the coast at 6 p.m. Monday, including such mainland areas as the south Brunswick peninsula, which includes a National Register historic district.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We're the only counties that have barrier islands with a lot of people on them,'' Abel said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Linda Padgett, administrative assistant at the Emergency Operations Center in Chatham County, said officials there are keeping close track of the storm.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We're still hoping it will turn more to the northeast,'' she said. In the meantime, she said, residents of Tybee Island as well as those on Wilmington, Skidaway, Isle of Hope and other islands linked to the mainland by low-lying causeways were being advised to seek shelter inland.
     </p>
     <p>
      Coastal officials planned to go to a mandatory evacuation, based on overnight reports from the National Hurricane Center. In Savannah, a mandatory evacuation for low-lying areas was to go into effect at 8 a.m. today and for all of Chatham County by noon.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``We know we're supposed to get hurricane-force winds and a storm surge of 9 to 16 feet above normal tide, because Floyd waited so long to start turning north,'' Abel said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier projections had the storm tracking farther east away from coastal Georgia but the 5 p.m. advisory Monday showed a revised path expected to bring tropical storm-force winds ashore by 2 a.m. Wednesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Schools in Chatham and Glynn counties cancelled classes for today and Wednesday.

      The Red Cross said shelters were opened to the north in Coffee County and Dublin last night.

      By late afternoon, hundreds of coastal residents were lined up at gas stations along the coast. The Home Depot in Brunswick sold out of plywood by mid-afternoon. Grocery store managers said customers were lining up to buy bottled water, batteries and canned foods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Telephone circuits were jammed with calls.

      On St. Simons Island, residents_especially those in homes near the beach_spent the afternoon Monday boarding up windows and moving outdoor furniture indoors.

      Woody Woodside, executive director of the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce, said there are still a number of tourists vacationing on the barrier islands.
     </p>
     <p>
      ``I'm sure they're concerned, as all of us are, and they're staying in touch with emergency officials,'' Woodside said. ``We've been fortunate so many times before and we're hoping we'll be lucky again.''
