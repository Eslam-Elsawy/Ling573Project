      In a press briefing, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur has received a note from the assistant director of the Malaysian Police informing the Philippines of the kidnapping.

      The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern Malaysia.

      He added that President Estrada had given the instructions to the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force in support of the border patrol agreement between the Philippines and Malaysia.

      "There is a border patrol agreement between the Philippines and Malaysia which has been activated and so elements of both countries are in operation in that area," Puno said.
