      KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.

      The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The Associated Press by telephone.

      Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and that they were still in Sabah. He said most of the hostages were Europeans and Americans.

      Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared with Indonesia.

      Sulaiman said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos. The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.

      Police are currently trying to trace the boat, he said. He said no demands had been announced.

      Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for Sabah, said the island was near two Malaysian naval bases on the eastern coast of Sabah.

      ''This has never happened here before, so I don't think there are any Malaysians involved,'' in the hostage taking, Chong said.

     <p>
      Chong said the area was considered one of the top 10 diving spots in the world and that six resorts on the island cater mostly to professional divers.
     </p>
     <p>
      He said access to the island was restricted to 80 divers at one time, and 40 staff at the six resorts, to protect the coral reef and wildlife.

      Malaysia and Indonesia both claim sovereignty over the Celebes Sea islands. The Southeast Asian neighbors have both filed claims with the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands.
     </p>
     <p>
      The argument over the islands dates back to 1969, when Indonesia and Malaysia failed to reach agreement during technical discussions about the overlapping continental shelf that borders the neighboring countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      But there were no early indications that the assailants were involved in the territorial dispute.
