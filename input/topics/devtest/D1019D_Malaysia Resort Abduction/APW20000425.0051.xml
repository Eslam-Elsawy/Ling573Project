      SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Authorities hunted the seas between Malaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlled by heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from a Malaysian diving resort two days earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      The kidnapping might be tied to Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the United States, although some authorities said the Abu Sayyaf rebels were just trying to attract attention.
     </p>

      ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad told Philippine radio station DXRZ.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several hours later, however, Ahmad said he would neither confirm nor deny his group was involved.
     </p>

      Officials were searching today for the hostages -- half of whom are foreign tourists. They were taken Sunday night from lush Sipadan Island off the northern Borneo state of Sabah.
     </p>
     <p>
      A police intelligence report said the hostages were taken to the province of Sulu at the southern tip of the Philippines, no more than an hour's boat ride from Sipadan. But Lt. Edgar Joseph Andres, a navy pilot, said he found nothing in a three-hour search of the sparsely inhabited area today.
     </p>
     <p>
      Malaysian officials said today that the kidnappers were believed to be outside Malaysian waters.
     </p>

      A waitress from the Philippines who escaped the abduction added weight to the Muslim rebels' claim that they were involved. Jeneth Cagaanan said when one of the men grabbed her, she replied to him in Suluk -- the language prevalent in the southern Philippines -- and that he understood her.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cagaanan also said one of the assailants wore a vest emblazoned with the initials of the Moro National Liberation Front, the Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group before it signed a peace accord in 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      Five people were being questioned in connection with the abduction, Sabah chief of police Mamat Talib said.
     </p>
     <p>
      Police said some of those arrested were former employees of the Sipadan resort and were tied to the Filipino fishing community along Sabah's eastern coastline.
     </p>
     <p>
      The attack on Sipadan began Sunday when six masked gunmen, carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher, grabbed tourists and workers and confiscated their cash and jewelry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The gunmen then forced their hostages to swim to two fishing boats, which sped away and appeared to be heading toward Philippine waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eyewitnesses said two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y. -- escaped after James Murphy told the assailants his wife didn't know how to swim. When the kidnappers turned around, the American couple ran into the bushes and hid until dawn.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, James Murphy declined today to talk extensively about his ordeal. ''We don't want our comments to overshadow anything that's going on with the situation,'' he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included tourists -- two French, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese -- and nine Malaysians who either worked at the resort or for the wildlife service. One was a Filipino resort employee and the nationality of the 21st hostage wasn't immediately released.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another hostage situation was escalating in a remote area of the southern Philippines, about 275 miles north of Semporna, the port from which tourists take boats for Sipadan. On the island province of Basilan, troops shelled Abu Sayyaf camps again today as soldiers battled their way up a mountain where the rebels were holding 27 Filipinos captive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Jose Calimlim, chief of intelligence for the Philippine military, said an air force plane and navy boats were searching Philippine waters near Malaysia for the hostages captured Sunday. He doubted the Abu Sayyaf claim of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''This is a part of their propaganda because they are really trying to attract attention, especially international attention,'' he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rebels have demanded the freedom of Arab terrorist suspects in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad insisted Malaysia was still a safe tourist destination. The Sabah economy relies heavily on the 400,000 people who visit its beach resorts and rain forests every year.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''We don't get this kind of thing happening in Malaysia very often,'' Mahathir said. ''It will affect tourism in Sabah, but the rest of the country is not affected by this. Malaysia is very safe for tourists.''
     </p>
     <p>
      That may be of little comfort to Yee Mui Phia, a guide at Sipadan Dive Center who sat today in his empty office in Semporna.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''We are scared,'' he said. ''And what's more important, it will affect our business.''
