     Gunmen Take Hostages in Malaysia

      SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Rescue teams were searching Southeast Asian seas on Tuesday for assailants who abducted 20 hostages from a Malaysian diving resort -- an attack that Philippine Muslim rebels claimed they carried out.

      Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping. Philippine officials, who were helping coordinate the rescue attempt, quickly expressed skepticism over the statement.
     </p>

      An American couple escaped the Sunday evening attack in Malaysia by refusing to swim out to the kidnappers' boats and then hiding overnight in nearby bushes.

      Malaysian Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Monday that an air-and-sea search team had determined where the hostages -- half of whom were foreign tourists -- were being held, following their abduction on the lush Sipadan Island in eastern Malaysia. Najib did not give details.

      But Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi said Tuesday that authorities had yet to pinpoint the abductor's hideout. ''We're tracking them down,'' he added.

      Nafir Sakaran, a state Cabinet minister at police headquarters in Semporna, told The Associated Press Tuesday that marine police and navy reinforcements have been brought in. ''The military has been called out. We have soldiers who are riding on patrol boats, working with the Philippine navy.''

      The attack began when six masked gunmen, carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher and speaking a Philippine language, grabbed tourists and workers and confiscated their cash and jewelry, Norian said.

      A local marine photographer said one of the attackers identified himself as a police officer and told him to give up his watch and cellular phone.

      ''At first I thought he was joking ... but when I refused to obey his orders, he held a gun to my head,'' Danny Chin, 48, was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chin said he hid in the woods while the kidnappers ransacked the resort.

      The attackers then forced their hostages to swim a distance to two fishing boats, which then sped away and appeared to be heading into Philippine waters, officials said.

      Two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y. -- managed to escape. Eyewitnesses said Mary Murphy didn't know how to swim, and her husband told the assailants they'd have to shoot him if they forced her into the water. The kidnappers apparently let them go, and the American couple ran into the bushes and hid until dawn.
     </p>

      The Murphys, who have been living in Australia the past two years, arrived in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Monday evening but said they didn't want to talk to the media extensively until the hostages are released.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives,'' James Murphy told The Associated Press at the airport. ''We haven't slept yet, but yes, we are fine.''
     </p>
     <p>
      The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included two French tourists, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one Lebanese, as well as a Filipino worker and nine Malaysians, authorities said.

      In Basilan, Philippines, Philippine troops shelled rebel camps again Tuesday as soldiers battled their way up a mountain where Abu Sayyaf rebels were holding 27 Filipinos captive.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf, said in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rebels have demanded the freedom of three Arab terrorist suspects in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military is still determining whether the Abu Sayyaf, which is fighting for an independent Islamic state in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, is actually responsible for the Malaysian abductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''We don't just jump and believe the Abu Sayyaf immediately. We will verify and confirm this,'' he told The Associated Press.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the rebel announcement, Col. Ernesto de Guzman, chief of staff of the Philippine military's Southern Command, said officials were trying to determine whether there was a connection with the hostage situation on the southern Philippine island of Basilan, about 275 miles northeast of Semporna, the port from which tourists take boats for Sipadan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Since 1969, Malaysia and Indonesia have both claimed sovereignty over Sipadan and Ligitan, another Celebes Sea island. But there were no indications that the hostage-takers were involved in the territorial dispute.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chong Kah Kiat, tourism minister for Sabah, said he was concerned that the attack would scare off the 400,000 tourists who visit Sabah beaches and rain forests every year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile, at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, Mary Murphy was close to tears.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''We really need to talk to our children,'' she told the AP. ''We really want to get to the phone.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Her husband, an executive for Eastman Kodak Co. in Sydney, Australia, said they had not slept since Sunday night but were otherwise fine.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''She's got lots of bites from sleeping in the bushes, a lot of sand fleas,'' he said, pointing to his wife's legs, which were covered with a rash of insect bites.
     </p>
     <p>
      As cameras flashed around them, Mary Murphy, wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, said all she wanted was ''a good night's sleep and a hot shower.''
