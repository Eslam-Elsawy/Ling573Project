      KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- James and Mary Murphy were just another American couple escaping on a dream vacation to a lush Malaysian resort island.

      By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a mass abduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20 hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.

      ''We really need to talk to our children,'' Mary Murphy told The Associated Press at Malaysia's international airport. ''We really want to get to the phone.''

      The Murphys, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y., appeared shaken up and very much alone. Scores of reporters waited for them to arrive, but no Malaysian authorities or U.S. embassy officials were there to escort them from their plane after their long ordeal.

      Mary Murphy, wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, was close to tears. They had not yet informed their three children living in Boston, Rochester and Australia about their trauma. The Murphys have been living in Sydney for the past two years.

      Six gunmen stormed the Sipadan Island Resort off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah late Sunday, taking 20 people, including 10 foreign tourists, hostage on two boats.

      Rescue teams searching southeast Asian seas say they've zeroed on assailants -- an attack that the Philippine rebel group Bbu Sayyaf on Tuesday claimed it carried out.

      Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping. But Philippine officials quickly expressed skepticism over the statement.

      The Murphys escaped by refusing to get on the boats, according to police in Semporna. Eyewitnesses said the hostages were forced to swim to the boats. They said Mary Murphy couldn't swim and when the kidnappers tried to force her, her husband said they'd have to shoot him if they forced her into the water.

      When the hostage-takers turned around, the Murphys ran into the bushes and hid until dawn, eyewitnesses said.

      When asked if this was an accurate account, the Murphys smiled but would not elaborate. Asked if they had hidden in the bushes, Murphy said, ''We did that.''

      Murphy, an executive for Eastman Kodak Co. in Sydney, said they had not slept since the previous night but were otherwise fine.

      ''She's got lots of bites from sleeping in the bushes, a lot of sand fleas,'' he said, pointing to Mary Murphy's legs, which were covered with a rash of insect bites.
     </p>
     <p>
      Murphy said that he would speak more extensively once he knew that the other hostages were released and safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      ''I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives,'' he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      As cameras flashed around them, Mary Murphy said all she wanted now was ''a good night's sleep and a hot shower.''
