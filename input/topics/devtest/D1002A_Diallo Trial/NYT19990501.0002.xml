     FOUR OFFICERS IN DIALLO CASE RETURN TO TRIAL SET FOR JAN. 3

      NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
     </p>
     <p>
      They left the courtroom to the cheers of nearly 200 other officers, gathered outside the Bronx County Building.
     </p>
     <p>
      But inside state Supreme Court, the defense team showed signs of division.
     </p>
     <p>
      Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward McMellon. Kornberg said Worth, who had represented all of the officers immediately after the shooting, might have a conflict of interest now since he was representing only one of them and might be forced to cross-examine the others.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was a point that Worth disputed outside court by saying, ``I don't think I have a conflict of interest, though it is obvious that Kornberg would like for me to go.''
     </p>
     <p>
      Police officials declined to say where the officers _ Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy, Carroll and McMellon _ would be working, adding only that they were on modified duty and carrying no guns or badges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Worth said that the officers reported to their new assignments Friday but would not officially start work until Monday, on what police officials called administrative assignments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Friday, acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who refused defense requests to put off scheduling a date for the case, chose the Jan. 3 date after the defense lawyers said they would need time to go through the prosecution's evidence and discuss possible pretrial motions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in, like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant. That case is set to begin on Tuesday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prosecutors turned over more than 160 pages of forensic, ballistic and crime scene evidence to the defense lawyers, adding that more would be forthcoming. The judge said the next court appearance would be on Sept. 29, when she would decide all motions.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases. Defense lawyers are usually pleased by delays to the extent that they can temper bad publicity about the case, which they see as possibly prejudicial to their clients.
     </p>
     <p>
      But if the delay was welcome, there were still Kornberg's efforts to force Worth, the official lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, off the case. Kornberg said later that if Worth was not disqualified, Kornberg might push for a separate trial for Carroll.
     </p>
     <p>
      The issue of severing the cases is important because the defendants will probably need one another's testimony to corroborate their accounts of the shooting.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, the defense has suggested that the 41 shots fired at Diallo _ a number that has become a flash point in the case _ were precipitated by one of the officers yelling ``Gun!'' and another falling down some steps as if he had been shot.
