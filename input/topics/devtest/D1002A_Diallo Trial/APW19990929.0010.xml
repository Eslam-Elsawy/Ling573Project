      Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment. They have all pleaded innocent to second-degree murder.

      The judge rejected defense arguments that public outcry and intense media coverage following the shooting put undue pressure on the grand jury to issue the murder indictments.

      The officers were indicted in March. They are accused of firing 41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on Feb. 4. Diallo was hit 19 times. Attorneys for the officers said their clients mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun.

      The defendants remain on restricted duty pending the outcome of the trial, which is scheduled for January.
