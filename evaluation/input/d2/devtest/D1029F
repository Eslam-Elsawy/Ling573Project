Lasi said government officials and their families starting leaving the town on Saturday morning in vehicles escorted by paramilitary troops after receiving a warning from the chief of the Bugti tribe, Nawab Akbar Bugti, that he could not guarantee their safety.
Up to 50 tribesmen may also have died in Thursday's clashes, an opposition member of parliament and other sources said, although the government and the military dismissed the figure and it could not be independently confirmed.
