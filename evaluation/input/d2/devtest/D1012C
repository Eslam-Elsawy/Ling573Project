US investigators were on their way to Athens as US law requires them to help with the investigation whenever a US-made aircraft is involved.
Roussopoulos said the black box of the plane had been found and investigation of the cause had been under way.
Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said.
