Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
"We are vigorously opposed to what they are seeking to do... and we're continuing to be at the forefront of the campaign to have a South Pacific whale sanctuary and that is the effort we will continue to make," Ruddock said.
