About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.
The government wants only 8 percent of women and 6 percent of men, aged 16 to 64, to be overweight by 2005: the same proportion as in 1980.
But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women, drinking by women and smoking by the young.
