''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Ahmad, spokesman for the Philippine rebel group Abu Sayyaf, said in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
He said the ground troops were pursuing fleeing rebels, and the troops next plan to advance to the main stronghold further up the mountain, he said.
