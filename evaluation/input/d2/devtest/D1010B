EU embargoes on British beef from animals aged over 30 months could be lifted from next year following a 95 percent fall in the number of cases of mad cow disease recorded in Britain over the past three and a half years, according to a European Commission report released Monday.
Ireland banned the use of meat and bone meal as cattle feed, the suspected origin of mad cow disease, in 1990.
