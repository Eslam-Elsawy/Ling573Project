Here in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the closest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not panicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow into the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating debris in 1980.
"The history of this volcano suggests that this could be the opening salvo of more eruptions," he said adding that the small 1986 eruption was similar to the latest one.
