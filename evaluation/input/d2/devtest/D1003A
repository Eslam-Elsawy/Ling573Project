Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
The third national survey on giant pandas, which began in 2000 and ended last year, shows that pandas live in mountain areas of 20 towns of eight counties along the east-west Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province.
By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
