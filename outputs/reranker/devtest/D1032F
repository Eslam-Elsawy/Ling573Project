Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Monday that it was trying to seal off a gas leak on a platform in the North Sea where production had been suspended and most employees evacuated owing to the risk of an explosion.
"It is probably impossible to say anything until the end of next week end about the date at which the Snorre A and Vigdis (platforms) will be able to resume activity," Statoil, the operator of the two installations, said in a statement.
