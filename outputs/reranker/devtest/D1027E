(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover sexual orientation.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
