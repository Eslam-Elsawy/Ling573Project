Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
"It is so hard to say in brief, but the level of devastation of coastal areas by the disaster is obvious," director of Conservation International in the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Ketut Sarjana Putra, said.
The ocean's seagrass bed and mangrove ecosystem would also be affected, Putra said, but it is the reefs that bore the brunt of the destruction.
