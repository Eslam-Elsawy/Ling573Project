The shutdown of Snorre and production in the nearby Vigdis field cut Norway's production by 205,000 barrels of oil a day, or 6.4 percent of the nation's roughly 3.2 million barrel daily production.
Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained "unclear" when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week.
