Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
Although the police chief and district attorney both have said that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they have not formally named any suspects.
Burke was in the family's Boulder home when 6-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996.
Police say her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion.
