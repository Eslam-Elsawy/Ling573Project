The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake the coast by the middle of the week.
The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye blowing at 155 mph.
