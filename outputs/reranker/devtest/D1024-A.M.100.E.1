He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant. Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons. At first, he thought the nearby power station had been struck, he said. Four of them were critically hurt, he said.
