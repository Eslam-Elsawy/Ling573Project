About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.
Bashir said that he would prove that the pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed.
In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had given key financial help for the plant that was part of the ``Sudanese military industrial complex.''
