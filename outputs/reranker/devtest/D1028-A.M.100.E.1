The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years.
Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors' request and had authorized the death penalty in the case, and said the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later on Thursday in Sacramento, California, where the case is pending.
Kaczynski has also pleaded innocent in the case.
