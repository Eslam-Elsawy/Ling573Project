Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors' request and had authorized the death penalty in the case, and said the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later on Thursday in Sacramento, California, where the case is pending.
In a statement, Washington, D.C. attorney Anthony Bisceglie said he had informed Kaczynski's brother David and his mother Wanda of Reno's decision to authorize prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the case.
