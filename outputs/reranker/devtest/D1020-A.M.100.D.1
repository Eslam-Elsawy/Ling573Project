But no illnesses have been reported in connection to the beef produced on that day and the company said it had notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which was testing the product.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of that year.
