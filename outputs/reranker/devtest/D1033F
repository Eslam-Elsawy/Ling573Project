However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to the spokesman.
President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in the 1997 presidential election.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
Hong has offered to resign the ambassadorship.
