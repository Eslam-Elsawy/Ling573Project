The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
Eyewitnesses said the hostages were forced to swim to the boats.
Police there said the kidnappers in Malaysia spoke Tausug, a language spoken in parts of the southern Philippines, but not in Basilan, where the Abu Sayyaf rebels operate.
Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and that they were still in Sabah.
