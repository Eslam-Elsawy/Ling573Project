The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
"Sudan I can contribute to an increased risk of cancer but at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small," the agency said in a statement.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
It is not allowed to be added to food in the Europe Union.
