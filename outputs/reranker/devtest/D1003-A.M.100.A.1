The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said.
Twenty-two giant pandas living in parts of Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu will be moved to other locations with better food, the China Daily said, quoting Zhang Kerong, director of the reserve.
The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province.
The Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve is home to more than 100 giant pandas.
