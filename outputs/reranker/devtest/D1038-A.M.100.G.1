A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
The volcano alert of Mount St. Helens was raised to Level 3, which "indicates we feel an eruption is imminent, or is in progress," said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Tom Pierson from the observatory.
"The eruption was predominantly steam but containing a little bit of ash," he said adding that there were no lava or mud flows from the crater and that the alert level in the region had not been raised.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
