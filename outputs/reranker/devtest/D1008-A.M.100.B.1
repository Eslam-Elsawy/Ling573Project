Here is the progress on a few of the important goals for the bay, based on information from the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program.
As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says.
Baker said that environmentalists are frustrated that the bay has made so little progress in the three decades since the cleanup began, and particularly in the four years since the signing of the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
