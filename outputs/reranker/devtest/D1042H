The defense on Monday demanded that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.
"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer," said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.
Graner was convicted and sentenced in January to 10 years in prison and dismissed from the military.
