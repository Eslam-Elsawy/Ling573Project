The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the 5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43 percent are in a population decline -- many for unknown reasons.
In the United States, 21 percent of known species are threatened or extinct.
The researchers called for efforts to protect the habitat of amphibians and to reproduce the threatened species in captivity.
Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on land and in water.
