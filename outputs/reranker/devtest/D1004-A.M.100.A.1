Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape. Igara said reports so far indicated that a community school, government station, Catholic mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of Aitape had been completely destroyed, where 30 people were dead. "They are scattered all over in the mangroves." Another five people died in the Teles-Lambu villages.
