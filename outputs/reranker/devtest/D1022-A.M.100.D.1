Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
The International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, but Japan's scientific hunt, in which hundreds of whales are killed each year, is widely regarded as a way of circumventing the moratorium.
The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month.
