The face of the once youthful-looking Yushchenko, 50, was mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached Austria.
Yushchenko has said that if he is elected president, prosecutors will pursue investigations into the death of Gongadze and other high-profile criminal cases.

Nikolai Korpan, the doctor who oversaw Yushchenko's treatment, said no ``functional damage'' would remain as a result of the dioxin exposure.
