Students and citizens in the country have held various demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism during his 32-year rule.
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais urged the government to put Soeharto under city arrest and to confiscate his wealth and that of his family and cronies.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
