The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
Cui Xiaosu, an official in charge of the implementation of the project, said that the theme of the project will focus on environmental protection and help the poor in the project area.
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties.
