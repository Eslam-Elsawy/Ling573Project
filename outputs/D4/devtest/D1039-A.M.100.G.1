Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker and writer who had recently made a television film critical of Islam, was shot and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street on Tuesday.
It is assumed that Van Gogh was killed because of his outspoken criticism of Islam after police said the alleged gunman was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
Hirsi Ali, who has lived under police protection for two years, said she and Van Gogh had received death threats after the film was broadcast.
He said he would only report the threats to the police."
