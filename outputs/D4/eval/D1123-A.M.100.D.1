The US State Department said it was unaware of any international links to a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the US embassy in Athens early Friday which caused no injuries.
Greek police said a far-left group, Revolutionary Struggle, had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Greek authorities blamed domestic militant groups that have carried out a spate of bombings against police and government buildings despite a crackdown of terrorism before the Athens Olympics in 2004.
On Friday, the Greek authorities said they were investigating a claim that the rocket attack was also carried out by this extreme left-wing group.
