A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with another vessel in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday and leaked about 15,000 tons of crude oil, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil  about 1.8 million barrels  to be loaded into boats from a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was being towed by a small tug boat, Kim said.
Friday's accident is the largest offshore oil spill in South Korea.
We have 40 vessels out there fighting the oil spill."
