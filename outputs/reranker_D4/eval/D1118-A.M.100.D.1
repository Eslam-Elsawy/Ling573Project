Maruca-Kovac, who works at Nebraska Medical Center, said she was getting ready for work Wednesday when Hawkins phoned her at about 1 p.m., telling her he had left a note.
On Wednesday, the 19-year-old killed eight people and himself in a shooting rampage at an Omaha shopping mall, police said.
Surgical nurse Debora Maruca-Kovac, whose family took in Hawkins after her 17- and 19-year-old sons befriended him, said she saw victims of the mall shooting being brought in to the hospital where she works.
In the note, Maruca-Kovac said, Hawkins said "how sorry he was for everything."
