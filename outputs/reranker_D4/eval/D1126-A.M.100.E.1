  An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it.
Bush joked, saying that all he can report was that it was a size 10 shoe.
"There is still more work to be done," Bush said after his meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, adding that the agreement puts Iraq on solid footing.
Bush ducked, and it narrowly missed his head.
