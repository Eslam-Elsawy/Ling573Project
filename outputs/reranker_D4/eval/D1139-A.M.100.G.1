  Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a regional maritime official said on Monday.
Vela, the ship's owner and operator, is one of the largest crude oil tanker companies in the world.
The supertanker, about the same length as an American Nimitz class aircraft carrier, is the largest ship known to have been seized by pirates, and it was fully loaded with 2 million barrels of oil.
Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year.
They do occasionally get nabbed, however.
