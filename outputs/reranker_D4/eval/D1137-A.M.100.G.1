About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.
The crane split into pieces as it fell, pulverizing one small, brick apartment building and demolishing parts of several other buildings on Manhattan's East Side.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least 10 people were injured in what he called one of New York City's worst construction accidents.
