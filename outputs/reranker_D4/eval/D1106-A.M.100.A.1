About 300 representatives from five international conservation bodies and more than 60 countries and regions gathered in the Japanese port city of Kobe on Monday for a five-day meeting to talk about optimal and sustainable ways to strengthen the conservation of tuna as the stocks are rapidly declining due to overfishing.
The conference brings together the world's regional tuna management groups and runs through Friday in the western city of Kobe.
The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.
