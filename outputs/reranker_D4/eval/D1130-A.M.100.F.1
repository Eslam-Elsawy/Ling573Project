Ships and rescue teams scoured rough seas off Indonesia for hundreds of people still missing after a ferry disaster off Java island, as more weary survivors were plucked to safety.
Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said Monday nearly 200 had been found alive and vowed to keep up search and rescue efforts for at least a week, as an air force plane dropped food and water to some survivors stranded in the Java Sea.
The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
Three unidentified victims were buried Wednesday.
