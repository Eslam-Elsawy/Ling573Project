The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.
"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun."
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight.
The study reported a possible association between the vitamin and cancer, not a cause-and-effect relationship.
