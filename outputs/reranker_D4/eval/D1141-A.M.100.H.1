China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area, sources with the Ministry of Water Resources said on Thursday.
By the end of 2005, the region has curbed soil erosion on more than 7,400 sq km of land.
China is managing to reverse soil erosion in many areas, he said.
At the current rate at which damaged areas are being recovered  1,000 square kilometers per year  Guizhou would need at least 70 years to bring soil erosion under control, he added.
It's the fourth consecutive year the so-called No.
