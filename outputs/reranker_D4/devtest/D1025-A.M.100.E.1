Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Fish and Wildlife Service is poised to remove the park's renowned bears from the endangered species list.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Removing protection, they say, would not allow the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to halt development in a crucial grizzly habitat.
"We're not saying things will always be stable," said Servheen.
