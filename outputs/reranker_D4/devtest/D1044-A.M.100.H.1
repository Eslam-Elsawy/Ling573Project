The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has launched an unprecedented probe into how a potentially cancer-causing dye contaminated at least 474 products, ranging from ready-made meals to popular sauces, that have been withdrawn from sale.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
