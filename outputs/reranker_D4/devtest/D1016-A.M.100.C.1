  Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
Students and citizens in the country have held various demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism during his 32-year rule.
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
