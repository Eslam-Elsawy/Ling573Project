In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
 Hong Kong's Department of Health on Thursday reported four more suspected cases of Influenza A H5N1, bringing the number to 10 in addition to nine confirmed cases.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
