President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
MBC, a major local broadcasting company, released parts of an eavesdropped conversation in which Hong allegedly discussed with a senior Samsung Group official to donate slush fund to candidate of the Grand National Party Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 presidential election.
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South Korean Ambassador to the United States.
Samsung apologized Monday over the issue.
