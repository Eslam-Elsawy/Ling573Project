Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.
Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
