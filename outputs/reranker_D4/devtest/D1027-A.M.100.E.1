(AP)  The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard will begin with jury selection March 24.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
McKinney's trial is scheduled for August.
