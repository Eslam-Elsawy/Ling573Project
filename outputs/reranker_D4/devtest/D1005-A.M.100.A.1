Cures for these and other diseases, many scientists now believe, could come from research into human embryonic stem cells.
The debate centers on whether the embryos used in stem cell research are human beings.
"When these same Parkinson's patients take their dopamine medication, they show the reverse pattern, learning better from positive feedback and worse from negative feedback than controls," said the University of Colorado research team.
It's better to use these embryos to help others, they argue.
Some people, including some religious groups, say embryonic stem cell research should be banned because it ends a human life.
