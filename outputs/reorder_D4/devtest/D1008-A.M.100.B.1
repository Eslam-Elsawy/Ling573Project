In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., and several states vowed that the Chesapeake Bay would be cleaned up within 10 years.
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative  and, they hope, disease-resistant  species to the bay.
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay.
Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
As their numbers grow, industry officials said, bass are eating too many menhaden.
