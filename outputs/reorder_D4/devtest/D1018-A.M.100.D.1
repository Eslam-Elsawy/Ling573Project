Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but both have since been released.
