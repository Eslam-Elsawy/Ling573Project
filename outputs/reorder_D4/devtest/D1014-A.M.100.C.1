According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily" reports today.
About 70 million Chinese people, mostly city dwellers, are obese, and the number is on the rise as people's living standards have greatly improved in recent years.
The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the standard in developed countries.
They also found that the higher education levels people have, the less they are likely to suffer from obesity, especially among women.
