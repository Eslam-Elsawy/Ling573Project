Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Japan has not previously killed humpbacks or fin whales as part of its research program, which began in 1987.
