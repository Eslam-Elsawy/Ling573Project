  South African Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday confirmed that two South Africans are among the 21 people taken hostage by gunmen in Malaysia's famed diving island of Sipadan.
Most of the hostages are foreign tourists, police said.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.
Sulaiman said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos.
