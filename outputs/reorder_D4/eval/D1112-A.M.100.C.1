Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty after charging him with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
Romero was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale.
"On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people," Monaghan said.
The resulting crash killed 11 people and injured about 180.
