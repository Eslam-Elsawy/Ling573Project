Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said Monday nearly 200 had been found alive and vowed to keep up search and rescue efforts for at least a week, as an air force plane dropped food and water to some survivors stranded in the Java Sea.

More than 150 people have been rescued and dozens of bodies have either been spotted or collected, authorities say.
