About 19 of the 44 stories of the crane had been erected and it was to be extended Saturday, when a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of Reliance Construction Group, which manages construction at the site.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people, believed to be construction workers, have died and at least 10 people were injured in one of the city's worst construction accidents in recent memory.
The crane split into pieces as it fell, pulverizing one small, brick apartment building and demolishing parts of several other buildings on Manhattan's East Side.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people have died and at least 10 people were injured in one of the city's worst construction accidents in recent memory.
The crane, about 19 stories high, demolished parts of several buildings as it fell.
Four construction workers were killed Saturday afternoon when a towering crane toppled onto a Manhattan apartment building, in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city's worst construction accidents ever.
About 19 of the planned 43-story condominium had been erected, and the crane was scheduled to be extended Saturday so workers could start work on a fresh story, said an owner of the company that manages the construction site.

Crews removed one section of the 19-story-tall crane that crashed onto the four-story brownstone and seriously damaged five other buildings in an affluent East Side neighborhood.
About 19 of the planned 44-story condominium had been erected, and the crane was scheduled to be extended Saturday so workers could start work on a fresh story, said an owner of the company that manages the construction site on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue.
The crane split into pieces as it fell.
Some residents said they had complained to the city several times about the construction site.
The missing people were two other construction workers and a woman who was staying at an apartment in the town house, the mayor said.
The crane split into pieces as it fell Saturday afternoon, pulverizing a four-story town house and demolishing parts of five other buildings.
The accident happened on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue at about 2:20 p.m. at the construction site of a high-rise condominium.
The crane, reaching 19 stories tall, collapsed during construction of a 43-story building on 51st Street, splitting into pieces shortly after 2 p.m., officials said.
But when one of them collapsed on the East Side on Saturday  killing at least four people, demolishing a building and damaging at least five others  the disaster exposed the often-uneasy relationship cranes have had with the New Yorkers who walk below them.
A city Department of Buildings official said the crane was inspected Friday and that the agency issued the builder, Reliance Construction Group, a variance to use it Saturday to lift a new section to lengthen the tower.
The crane was to be extended Saturday so workers could start work on a new level of the planned 43-story building, said an owner of the company that manages the construction site.

The five-story building was demolished.
Rescue crews worked through the night into Sunday morning sifting through piles of rubble in search of survivors after a towering crane at a construction site toppled like a tree across a city block, destroying buildings and killing at least four people.
Stephen Kaplan, who owns the Reliance Construction Group, which manages the site's construction, told The Associated Press a piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding the crane to the building.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the construction crash "one of the worst the city has had."
The mayor called the collapse, at the construction site of a new high-rise condo building, one of the city's worst construction accidents.
The authorities said 24 people were injured, including 11 first responders, and at least three people remained missing: two construction workers and a woman who was inside the four-story town house at 305 E. 50th St. that was demolished.
Three people were still listed as missing Sunday as rescue teams picked through the rubble of a town house crushed by a toppling construction crane in an accident that killed four construction workers.
The big, white crane stood at least 19 stories high and had been attached to the side of a half-built high rise.
The four confirmed killed were construction workers at 303 E. 51st St., where construction crews have built about 19 stories of a concrete-and-metal frame of a planned 43-story residential building.
The crane that fell had stood at least 19 stories high and had been attached at various points to the side of a half-built apartment tower.
Neighbors said they had complained to the city about the crane.
"It was an absolute freak accident," he said Saturday.
Saturday's accident was the most recent of several high-profile construction accidents that have come during a building boom in the city.
A giant crane separated from the side of a skyscraper under construction and smashed into a block of residential buildings Saturday, killing at least two people on Manhattan's East Side.
Yet, it was perhaps a testament to the city's reliance upon cranes that workers at the accident site were using other cranes to stabilize and assess the one that toppled.
Kaplan said the company had subcontracted the work to different companies and was not in charge of the crane.

A piece of steel fell and sheared off one of the ties holding it to the building, causing the structure to detach and topple, said Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group.
At least 17 others were injured in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city's worst construction accidents.
On Sunday, construction crews positioned a second crane to help remove pieces of the toppled structure and started removing piles of debris from the street.
The crane was in that process, known as "jumping," when it fell, officials said.
The city had issued 13 violations at the construction site in the past 27 months.

The four dead were all believed to be construction workers on a new high-rise condo building.
"If it had been pointing north, it would have pulled the crane into the building."
Fire Department officials said at least two people were dead, and several others were taken to two area hospitals.
As it fell south, the lower section of the tower, about 19 stories high, clipped a corner of a brick residential building across the street, seriously damaging apartments but causing no serious injuries to residents, officials said.
A crane tower at an East Side construction site toppled out of a blue sky without warning Saturday, killing four construction workers and injuring eight others, three of them critically, authorities said.
A crane mounted to the side of a skyscraper under construction toppled with a roar Saturday, smashing into a block of apartment buildings, killing at least four people and setting off a scramble for survivors in the rubble.
"We just walked by and said, 'If it falls, would it take her building out?"'
John LaGreco, who owns Fubar in the crushed building, said he feared one of his employees was dead inside.
At least one man inside the brownstone was pulled out alive but seriously injured, while rescue workers continued to search for a woman believed to be inside when the building came down, fire officials said.
The crane broke into pieces Saturday afternoon as it came loose from its supports, toppling across 51st Street and the buildings between there and 50th Street.
The collapse comes amid a building boom in New York City and follows a spate of construction accidents in recent months, including a few involving cranes.

On Sunday, construction crews positioned a second crane to help remove pieces of the white crane that crushed the townhouse, and started removing piles of bricks and debris from the middle of the street.
A crane mounted to the side of a skyscraper under construction toppled with a roar, smashing into a block of apartment buildings, killing at least four people and setting off a scramble for survivors in the rubble.
Stroh's company was helping Sunday with the removal of a crane piece that lay tilted against an apartment house on 51st Street, opposite the construction site, according to officials.
The crane was owned by New York Crane Equipment Corp., but it had apparently been leased to one of the contractors involved in the project.
Four construction workers  a crane operator and three riggers who were helping to "jump" the crane, or increase its height  were killed.
Now she lives in a five-story building across from the crane at 245 10th Ave., and Saturday's collapse and her memories of the one in 2006 have made her uneasy.
The white metal tower, which stood next to a partially completed residential building on the north side of 51st Street near Second Avenue, toppled in mid-afternoon under calm winds.
At the site of the demolished town house, which had a bar called Fubar in the ground floor and apartments above, ironworkers cut up sections of the toppled crane and removed pieces of the building.
The fallen crane had stood at least 19 stories high and was attached at various points to the side of a half-built apartment tower.
"I don't know what can be done about it," he said.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged the danger of high-rise construction but said residents near cranes were generally safe.
One man was pulled from a collapsed townhouse 3 1/2 hours after the building was crushed.
I thought the crane was coming in my window," she said.
Speaking at a news conference near the scene, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 24 people were injured.
There were at least five fatalities this year before the crane collapse Saturday.
One section that was lying on top of the remains of the town house jutted into 50th Street.
"It was an absolute freak accident," he said.

Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the intensive rescue operation would continue all night to find anyone possibly trapped in the rubble on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue.
The dead were all believed to be construction workers.
As the city's Department of Buildings defines them, "accidents" involve fatalities or injuries, and "incidents" do not.
John LaGreco, owner of the Fubar tavern on the townhouse's ground floor, returned Sunday to the devastated scene where an employee and a second person in the bar, which was closed, had been rescued, he said.
Rescuers were waiting for removal of the largest pieces of debris so they could intensify their search for possible survivors, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday.
"I heard a big crash, and I saw dust immediately.
Meanwhile, work crews and rescuers swarmed over the site of the disaster, on 51st Street and 50th Street just east of Second Avenue.
He said about 250 construction cranes are operating in the city, and he said the accident should not alarm people living near them.
Crews with search dogs and heat-sensing cameras sought survivors or more victims Sunday in piles of rubble after a giant crane at a Manhattan construction site toppled like a tree across a city block, destroying buildings and killing at least four people.
When it toppled from its base on the sidewalk, part of it landed on a four-story brownstone, and turned it into a pile of brick.
Like New Yorkers, they come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones that dominate in Manhattan are tower cranes, which are used in the construction of tall buildings.
Several blocks remained closed through the night and some residents were forced to stay at a nearby high school serving as a Red Cross shelter.

John LaGreco, who owned a tavern called Fubar that was closed when the brownstone was destroyed, said his employee, Juan Perez, was the man pulled from the rubble.
John LaGreco, 38, the owner of a bar called Fubar, which was on the ground floor of the destroyed building, identified one of those injured as Juan Perez, who he said worked as a porter at the bar.
A crane collapse on top of an office building sent pieces of granite, steel and glass falling 44 stories.
By the time they were done, the crane's tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories.
Several streets in the area remained closed, and officials said they hoped to have at least one lane of Second Avenue opened by Monday morning.
At East 23rd Street, the giant white crane fixed to the building under construction was the talk of the neighborhood.
Officials said about 250 cranes were in operation in the five boroughs, a telling sign of the city's building boom.
The collapse Saturday of the 205-foot crane  described by city and union officials as one of the worst crane accidents in memory  gave rise to a grim New York City parlor game, one that pedestrians have doubtlessly played in the back of their minds over the years: If that crane over there fell, where would it hit?
New York Crane was involved in a 2006 mishap, in which a 13-foot (4-meter) piece of a crane mast that was being dismantled fell into the street and crushed a taxi cab.
"It was so unnerving," said Leslie, an accountant.
On Saturday, hundreds of workers boiled about the site, and several other cranes were brought in to help lift heavy sections of latticed steel from the toppled crane.
That piece sheared off a lower collar and the entire structure toppled, the city officials said.
The construction site has been cited 13 times for violations since January 2006, said city officials, who added that the number was not unusual.
City Building Department records showed that on March 4, a caller told officials that the upper portions of the crane appeared to lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the building.

Rescuers used listening devices, heat detection and specially trained dogs to search for anyone else possibly trapped in rubble, Bloomberg said.
Nine others were treated at the scene, including five firefighters, officials said.
The top section of the crane crushed a four-story townhouse when it fell, said Jim Long, a New York Fire Department spokesman.
They began to remove portions of the broken crane's white lattice tower, one leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street and another, which had broken off and tumbled through the air, lying across a demolishedfour-story town house on 50th Street.
In 2006, a 13-foot (4-meter) piece of a crane mast that was being dismantled fell into the street and crushed a taxi cab.
"This is going to be a painstaking, hand operation as we try to remove the rubble," said New York Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta.
All of his employees were accounted for.
Shandley, who lives in the penthouse, said crane anxiety after Saturday's collapse was "an irrational fear."
No one else had been found in the demolished brownstone as of Sunday, authorities said.
Leslie, 49, who would give only her first name, was standing at East 51st Street and Second Avenue when she heard a metallic "clink-clink" and saw an elevator within the crane fall just before the crane itself toppled.
An intensive, but delicate rescue operation was under way to find anyone still trapped in the several-stories-high piles of rubble.
the mayor said at a news conference Sunday.
Witnesses reported a strong smell of gas in the area on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue.
The biggest building he had built before was a 14-story apartment building on East 30th Street in Manhattan.
Phone messages and an e-mail left for the crane company were not immediately returned.
Dogs and heat-seeking technology, were being used there as emergency workers searched the heap, while others worked to secure the broken crane, one section of which still rested against a damaged building Saturday night.

Lancaster said investigators were looking at how the collar was being maneuvered into place just before it fell and whether theslings might have broken.
One day that September, a four-ton chunk of steel rigging from the crane fell 20 stories to the ground, crashing onto a cab, injuring five people and forcing evacuations.
Lancaster said the company in charge of the crane was an Elizabeth, N.J., subcontractor on the construction project known as Joy Contractors Inc., identified as JCI in Building Department documents.
The collar, which officials said weighed about 12,000 pounds and was made of two U-shaped pieces of steel joined together, was to be secured to the tower and then tied by steel struts to the building.
"It continued building in strength until there was a final vroom!

"We would be dead if it wasn't on a Saturday," said Bryan Beus, an assistant for an artist who had office space in the crushed brownstone.
"There is a lot we don't know about why and what happened," Bloomberg said.
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said the rescue was "a painstaking hand operation, as we try to remove the rubble so we don't cause further collapse or injure anyone who may still be in that building."

The woman's friend was rescued, he said.
The accident occurred in Midtown Manhattan, and more than a half-dozen buildings near the site were evacuated.
The disaster occurred at 2:22 p.m. on Saturday, a day workers on the high-rise condominium under construction at 303 E. 51st St. had spent adding two or more 13-foot sections to increase the crane's height, a process known as "jumping" or "climbing" the crane.
New York has always been a city of construction cranes: They are the steel crutches of the skyline, forever pulling it upward.
Twenty-four others were injured, including 11 first responders, Bloomberg said.
Neighborhood residents said the boom of the crane often swings over the gas station to pick up materials on 24th Street.
The city had cited the construction of the 43-story condominium building for 13 violations  five of them still open  Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer said.
A city inspector visited the site and determined March 6 that no violation was warranted.
Goncalves, 33, used to live across the street from another crane in the East Village in 2006.

City Building Department records show that a caller told officials March 4 that the upper portions of the crane appeared to lack the proper number of safety ties attaching it to the building.
The violations include one, from February 2007, for failing to have a site-wide safety inspector.
Shandley, who works for a financial research company, added, "I don't think you should be any more worried about a crane than crossing the street and getting hit by a cab."
"They are working in a dangerous situation, and we want to make sure that nothing else happens," Bloomberg said at a news conference near the crushed building.

The spectacular collapse of a towering crane on the East Side began when a massivepiece of steel designed to secure it to a new high-rise building came loose and pancaked on top of a second support nine stories below, shearing it free and creating a fatal imbalance that sent the 22-story crane toppling across a two-block swath of Turtle Bay, officials said Sunday.
Crews worked illegal hours and the building was going up too fast, they said.

The person involved in the recovery provided a photograph of the collapsed collar showing one of the nylon straps still attached with what appeared to be a frayed and broken end.
Neighbors had also called in complaints, including on March 4, when a caller warned that the crane did not appear to be braced properly.
Officials said they were present for an inspection on Friday and wrote no violations.
"We're devastated by this tragedy, and our prayers are with the families," he said in the statement.
"I think a crane like that could still reach you across the street," he responded.
Stan Hochman, 83, who walked by the crane with his wife, said it made him nervous.
Ana Goncalves, who lives across the street, puts her faith in the builders and hopes they know what they are doing.
"He's one of the core employees of my business and I can't thank the Lord enough for him to still be alive," he said.

An intensive, but delicate rescue operation was under way to free anyone still trapped in the rubble.
There were 128 construction-related injuries last year, up from 116 in 2006, according to the Buildings Department.
"It crosses my mind every day," said Goncalves of the stability of the crane.
That building and seven others were partially or completely evacuated.
He said the operation would continue all night if necessary, including the use of search dogs and thermal-imaging and listening devices.
Maureen Shey, who lives diagonal from the building where the crane collapsed, said she was on the phone laying on her bed when she saw the giant white crane heading straight for her windows.
"I thought it was thunder but it kept going on and on and on," she said.
"Everybody was running, it was devastating," she said.
"I heard a big crash, and I saw dust immediately," said Maureen Shea, a 66-year-old retired banker who was lying in bed talking on the phone when she glanced out her window and saw bricks raining from the sky.

But as workers were maneuvering the collar into place, it broke free and plummeted down the crane's tower, like a ring around a steel tube sliding down.
Rescue crews were using search dogs, thermal-imaging cameras and listening devices.
On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 E. 51st St., saying workers were "jumping" the crane  intricately adding sections to raise the crane higher  when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the side of the building fell.
The collapse created a virtual war zone on an affluent block on Manhattan's East Side: Cars were overturned and crushed.
At that point, the workers turned to the process of bracing the crane by positioning a steel collar around the outside of the crane's tower at the building's 18th floor.
Buildings Department officials said construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued.
In 2006, a 13-foot (4-meter) piece of a crane mast that was being dismantled fell and crushed a taxi cab.

"Sadly, construction is a dangerous thing," said Bloomberg, a political independent.
Most people who had been displaced found lodging with relatives or made other arrangements.
"There are no words to describe the level of devastation we feel today as a result of this tragic event," James Kennelly, the lead partner at East 51st Development Company, which owns the property, said in a news release.
"We thought about it, and we think if it falls, it will probably fall into the park or bounce off that clock tower," said Jarrod Shandley, 25, who lives with two roommates in a penthouse that looks out onto a crane at East 23rd Street and Madison Avenue.
"We're still calling it a search operation, though with each passing hour, things are getting more grim," said Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner.
"It's unbelievable that this happened," LaGreco said.
Kerry Walker, a retired iron worker whose family owns the crushed building, said he had been concerned by the feverish pace of work at the nearby tower.
LaGreco said a female cousin of a seriously injured male resident of the building was missing.
Seventeen buildings were evacuated, and most people were still not able to get inside.
One man was pulled from a brownstone 3 1/2 hours after the building was crushed, but no one else was reported found.
She said she had been riding her bicycle nearby as the crane hit the building, and she saw the townhouse "falling like a house of cards."

One man, however, was given 10 minutes to dash into his apartment in the building at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue, which was damaged in the disaster, to retrieve his pet guinea pig.
The collision snapped the crane and sent its upper section sailing south, where it collided with two buildings on East 50th Street and landed on a brownstone, which contained apartments, offices and a bar.
Witnesses reported a strong smell of gas in the area.
Still, Sunday, virtually every crane in the city  no matter its safety record or soundness  was looked upon with skepticism by many pedestrians and residents.
