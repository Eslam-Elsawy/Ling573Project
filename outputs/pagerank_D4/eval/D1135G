Santander may face $3.1 billion in losses through its Optimal Investment Services, a Geneva-based fund of hedge funds that is owned by the bank.
It is the second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having investments in funds managed by Madoff.
The bank said it had also invested 17 million euros of its own funds in Madoff products.
Santander said its investment fund Optimal has an exposure of 2.33 billion euros (3.1 billion dollars).
But on Thursday, Madoff was charged with securities fraud after confessing to his sons that his business was a Ponzi scheme, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
BNP Paribas also refused to comment on reports that it had invested with Madoff.
Madoff was arrested on Thursday for allegedly defrauding his customers through a giant pyramid scheme, with prosecutors alleging that the 70-year-old, a decades- long veteran of Wall Street, confessed to losing at least 50 billion dollars in the so-called Ponzi scheme.
Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme that collapsed in the global financial crisis and top European banks are reported to be clients.

At the end of 2007, Optimal had 6 billion euros, or $8 billion, under management, according to the bank's annual report  which would mean that its Madoff investments were a substantial part of Optimal's portfolio.
A BNP Paribas said the bank had no direct investment with Madoff's company but "it does have risk exposure to these funds through its trading business and collateralized lending to funds of hedge funds.
He estimated that his investors had lost $50 billion.
French bank BNP Paribas has estimated its risk exposure to hedge funds managed by arrested Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff could lead to euro350 million ($466.9 million) in losses.
HSBC, one of the world's largest banks, also said it had made loans to institutions that invested in Madoff but did not disclose the size of its potential losses.
Madoff, a former chairman of Nasdaq stock market, was arrested Thursday in New York hours after the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
In a brief statement Sunday, the euro zone's largest bank said it has "no investment of its own" in Madoff's hedge funds but "does have risk exposure to these funds through its trading business and collateralized lending to funds of hedge funds."
The Madoff scandal could have a bigger impact in Spain than the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers this year, in which Spanish investors had exposure of between 1.3 and 2.6 billion euros.
Spanish newspapers reported that a fund run by leading bank Santander was heavily exposed and that investors in Spain risk losing some three billion dollars.
The report said that Union Bancaire Privee, a major asset management institution specializing in hedge funds, could be exposed to the tune of one billion dollars.
Swiss news media speculated Sunday that the total loss to banks in Switzerland could run into the billions of francs (dollars), but Swiss authorities said they were unable to say how much was at stake.
The New York Times reported that a hedge fund advisory firm, Fairfield Greenwich Group, had invested 7.5 billion dollars with Madoff.
Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
Madoff eventually attracted billions of dollars from investors.
Madoff, who allegedly told his employees he was running a "giant (pyramid) scheme," was freed on $10 million bail.
He has been accused by U.S. authorities of running a phony investment business that lost at least $50 billion.
They called it the "hedge fund" floor, but federal prosecutors now say the work Madoff did there was actually a fraud scheme whose losses Madoff himself estimates at $50 billion.
UBP refused to comment on the report, which said that 90 percent of fund management companies operating in Geneva invested in Madoff products.
As long as he could attract new investors the alleged scheme worked.
Several may have sustained billions of dollars in losses.
Madoff, a respected Wall Street money manger, was detained Thursday in what prosecutors say was a $50 billion scheme to defraud investors.
It may be the largest fraud in the history of Wall Street, authorities said.
The foundation had invested its endowment with Bernard L. Madoff, a storied name on Wall Street.
Media reports have said Europe's second-largest banking consortium, Spain's Grupo Santander SA, also has extensive exposure to Madoff's funds.
A letter to investors posted on the Lucerne bank's Web site Sunday says the exposure is through the Reichmuth Matterhorn, the bank's "fund of hedge funds," and that amount represents about 3.5 percent of the 11 billion francs ($9.4 billion) under the bank's management.
Madoff at some point started paying investors with money received from other investors, a Ponzi scheme, according to the SEC.
Spanish newspapers reported that Optimal, an investment firm of Banco Santander, was heavily exposed and that investors risked losing some three billion dollars.

The private Swiss bank Reichmuth Co says it has 385 million Swiss francs ($327 million) at risk in the case of U.S. financier Bernard L. Madoff, who has been accused of securities fraud.
But now, Noel and Fairfield are the biggest known losers in the scandal, facing potential losses of $7.5 billion, more than half its assets.
The only official statement has come from Spain's second largest bank, BBVA, which said it had not commercialised "any Madoff product."
And the private Swiss bank Reichmuth said it had 385 million Swiss francs, or $327 million, in potential losses.
Madoff's investors had requested the return of about $7 billion by the end of the year, part of a broad trend in which investors are pulling massive sums from Wall Street.
The sons reported Madoff to authorities.
The tally of reported losses climbed through the weekend to nearly $20 billion, with a giant Spanish bank, Banco Santander, reporting Sunday that clients of one of its Swiss subsidiaries have lost $3 billion.
He said his firm has been approached by two dozen investors, who lost up to $90 million.
"If, as a result of the alleged fraud, the value of the assets of these hedge funds is nil, BNP Paribas' loss could amount to around 350 million euros."
"It is astonishing that this apparent fraud seems to have been continuing for so long, possibly for decades, while investors have continued to invest more money into the Madoff funds in good faith," the firm said in a statement.

Jeffrey Tucker, a Fairfield co-founder and former federal regulator, said in a statement posted on the firm's Web site: "We have worked with Madoff for nearly 20 years, investing alongside our clients.
Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company.
Bramdean Alternatives invested around 21 million pounds (23.3 million euros, 31.2 million dollars), or around 9.5 percent of its portfolio, with Madoff's company.
A spokesman for Santander declined to comment on the case.
The returns paid to investors came from money invested by other people.
The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges he delivered consistently strong returns by secretly using the principal from new investors to pay out to other investors.
According to a criminal complaint filed with the court, Madoff told senior employees of his firm Wednesday that he had blown more than $50 billion with fraudulent financial moves, that he was "finished" and that he had "absolutely nothing."
Madoff told one of his sons earlier this month that he was struggling to find the money.
So far, only Madoff, the firm's 70-year-old founder, has been arrested in the scandal.
Fairfield was founded in 1983 by Noel, the former head of international private banking at Chemical Bank, and Tucker, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official.
The collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's company came just hours before his arrest Thursday on a single securities fraud count.
European media have said HSBC of Britain and Union Bancaire Privee of Switzerland could also have suffered, although neither has admitted or denied losing money.
"In an era of faceless organizations owned by other equally faceless organizations, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC harks back to an earlier era in the financial world: The owner's name is on the door," the company's Web site said.
Santander, Europe's second largest bank, has made no comment.
While many investors were friends or met Madoff at country clubs or on charitable boards, even more had entrusted their money to professional advisory firms that, in turn, handed it on to Madoff  for a fee.
The Sunday Telegraph also reported, citing experts, that British pension funds and insurance companies invested in Madoff's company.
A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the "systemic failure" of US regulators.
A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the "systemic failure" of US regulators.
Madoff's investors included a number of prominent hedge funds and the firm of Fred Wilpon, the owner of the New York Mets.
By the late 1970s, and perhaps earlier, Madoff began managing money for investors, at least in part because he could require people to process trades through his firm.
If the figures are confirmed, the fraud could have a bigger impact in Spain than the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers this year, in which Spanish investors had exposure of between 1.3 and 2.6 billion euros.
Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars (3.7 billion euros), Geneva's Le Temps newspaper said.
Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars (3.7 billion euros), Geneva's Le Temps newspaper said.
In recent regulatory filings, Madoff claimed to manage $17 billion for clients  a number that would normally occupy a staff of at least 200 employees, far more than the 20 or so who worked on 17.
Madoff's own $19 million foundation, which gave to a range of New York and Jewish causes, also was wiped out.
By the elevated standards of Wall Street, the Madoff firm did not pay exceptionally well, but it was loyal to employees even in bad times.
European media have said Banco Santander of Spain, BNPParibas of France, HSBC of Britain and Union Bancaire Privee of Switzerland could all have suffered.
"Walter was always really confident in Bernie and the strategy he employed," said one hedge fund manager who declined to be named because for fear of jeopardizing his relationship with Noel.
Fear ran deep for investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
A hotline number had been posted on the company Web site, madoff.com, but on Sunday night, Richards said that there was little reason to call.
Spanish authorities are taking the scandal very seriously and the central bank began an investigation on the impact on Friday, El Mundo said.
The list of prominent victims grew as well.
A British investment fund that counted itself a client of alleged Wall Street fraudster Bernard Madoff criticised the "systemic failure" of regulators in the United States on Sunday.
"Most investors, including ourselves, regarded the Madoff strategy as offering a stable source of returns," Nicola Horlick, Bramdean's chief executive, was quoted as saying in Britain's Sunday Telegraph.
But the damage appears to be deepest in the small world of Jewish philanthropy, where Madoff was a leading figure.
The company made its own trades and held the shares it bought, unusual practices that kept its activities hidden from view.
Such a tactic is highly unusual because it exposes a fund to large losses by forcing it to sell assets without regard to price.
A little bit later, it became clear that the money had melted away.
But a question still dominates the investigation: How one person could have pulled off such a far-reaching, long-running fraud, carrying out all the simple practical chores the scheme required, like producing monthly statements, annual tax statements, trade confirmations and bank transfers.
"FGG performed comprehensive and conscientious due diligence and risk monitoring," Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Fairfield, said in a statement.
Ira Lee Sorkin, an attorney for Madoff, said Madoff's firm "is cooperating fully with the government."
The plot appears to have unraveled when clients asked to withdraw their principal  as they have been doing from hedge funds worldwide  only to discover that Madoff's seemingly brimming coffers were empty.
In the industry, he had a reputation for safe investments and steady returns that made individual investors eager to place their money with him and competitors suspicious of his success.
Swiss bankers face losses of up to five billion dollars, Geneva's Le Temps newspaper said.
New Jersey U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg is on the growing list of potential victims of what prosecutors are calling a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme run by New York money manager Bernard Madoff.
"It is our intention to aggressively pursue the recovery of all assets related to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities," Tucker said in a statement.
Losses of this scale simply do not seem to fit into the intimate business that Madoff operated in New York.
On its Web site, the firm claimed to investigate hedge fund managers for six to 12 months before investing.
Other Swiss institutions, including Banque Benedict Hentsch and Neue Privat Bank, acknowledged being at risk, with Hentsch confirming about $48 million in exposure.
Europe's largest bank, HSBC, meanwhile, declined to confirm any relationship with the alleged fraudster.
A spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP on Sunday that the bank had "some exposure" to Madoff's company, but declined to give details.
According to a person familiar with the business of the real estate and publishing magnate Mort Zuckerman, he is also on a list of victims that already included the owners of the New York Mets, a former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles and the chairman of GMAC.
Some of the biggest losers were members of the Palm Beach Country Club, where many of Madoff's wealthy clients were recruited.
The company said the "apparent failure raises fundamental questions about the regulatory system under which this has happened and no doubt this will be the subject of intense debate as the facts emerge."
Now, Fairfield is seeking to recover what it can from Madoff.
Nevertheless, Madoff attracted and held the trust of companies that prided themselves on their diligent investigation of investment managers.
Evidence emerged that Madoff's alleged multi-billion-dollar fraud stretched from Tokyo to Europe to top US investors, all of them apparently unaware until the broker's arrest Thursday that they were being conned.
New York broker Bernard Madoff's alleged giant pyramid scheme duped some of the world's smartest investors, reports suggested Saturday, adding to questions about why the scam wasn't uncovered earlier.
One investor, Lawrence Velvel, 69, dean of the Massachusetts School of Law, said he and a friend may have lost millions of dollars between them.
"Our task is to find the records and follow the money," said Alexander Vasilescu, a lawyer in the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
As of Sunday night, he said, investigators could not shed much light on the fraud or its scale.
Banks and financial authorities across Europe scrambled Sunday to uncover the scope of losses suffered at the hands of New York investment broker Bernard Madoff.
Several large hedge funds invested with Madoff in part because he did not charge traditional fees, instead collecting money solely for processing trades.
According to The Wall Street Journal, investors facing losses include French bank BNP Paribas, Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings and Zurich's Neue Privat Bank.
But the 17th floor was Bernie Madoff's sanctum, occupied by fewer than two dozen staff members and rarely visited by other employees.
Noel first met Madoff in the 1980s, and Fairfield's fortunes grew along with the returns Madoff reported.
British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz, one of Britain's richest men, who apparently invested 40 million pounds with the firm.

Several British newspapers reported that among Bramdean's clients is property magnate Vincent Tchenguiz, one of Britain's richest men, who apparently invested 40 million pounds with the firm.
And the 17th floor is now an occupied zone, as investigators and forensic auditors try to piece together what Madoff did with the billions entrusted to him by individuals, banks and hedge funds around the world.
"Everybody heard of him," he said, noting his firm had received calls from investors Friday worried about their future.
Madoff, a former Nasdaq stock market chairman, founded his firm in 1960, using $5,000 he earned in part as a lifeguard on Long Island beaches.
He came to Wall Street with money saved as a Long Island lifeguard and built a family business employing many relatives, including his sons, and refused to sell the business or take it public.
Outside analysts had raised concerns about Madoff's firm for years.
As federal investigators poured over the books at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, the Times highlighted the apparent lack of oversight through the years of what appears set to be Wall Street's record-sized fraud.
US newspapers detailed how Madoff, 70, traded on his impeccable reputation and access to exclusive country clubs to cultivate A-list investment clients including big banks, hedge funds and individuals.
He declined to say whether Madoff, who has been released on bail, will fight the charges.
Madoff's family filled the senior positions, but his was not the only family at the firm  generations of employees had worked for Madoff.
Scrutiny is also falling on the many banks and money managers who helped steer clients to Madoff and now say they are among his victims.
Hedge funds are likely to take an especially big hit because Madoff was handling money for several companies raising money for such funds, the Journal said.
He helped pioneer electronic trading as an alternative to the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers meet in person, and he eventually became chairman of Nasdaq, the first electronic stock exchange.
One of them was Walter M. Noel Jr., who struck up a business relationship with Madoff 20 years ago that helped earn his investment firm, the Fairfield Greenwich Group, millions of dollars in fees.
Officials with the Securities and Exchange Commission were due in federal court Friday after a judge put a temporary hold on some assets of the firm until a court-appointed receiver could take control of its finances.
Even before Madoff collapsed, some employees were mystified by the 17th floor.
"This was extremely secretive, even for the non-transparent world of hedge funds," said Jake Walthour Jr., head of advisory services for Aksia, a New York consulting firm that advised clients not to invest in Madoff's funds.
The Geneva-based Banque Benedict Hentsch Fairfield Partners SA says its exposure is 56 million Swiss francs ($47.5 million) of client assets.
But a large number of investors apparently could not resist.
In 2001, Madoff called Fairfield and invited the firm to inspect his books after two news reports questioned the validity of his returns, according to a person close to Fairfield.
In Britain, a spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP the bank had "some exposure" to Madoff, but declined to give details.
A spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland told AFP that the bank had "some exposure" to Madoff's company, but declined to give details.
Working alongside the federal investigators on Madoff's 17th floor, staffers for Lee S. Richards 3d, the court-appointed receiver for the firm, are trying to determine what parts of the firm can keep operating to preserve assets for investors.
Bramdean Alternatives Limited said the accusations against Madoff raised "fundamental questions" about the American financial regulatory system.

The debacle has "swept up some of the most prominent and wealthy Americans, along with many people who thought they were embarking on a comfortable retirement and have now been left destitute," the Journal quoted a lawyer for another victim, Milberg LLP, as saying.
Those who have acknowledged potential losses so far include former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon, and J. Ezra Merkin, the chairman of GMAC Financial Services, among others.
It added: "The allegations made appear to point to a systemic failure of the regulatory and securities markets regime in the US."
"We are doing everything we can to protect the assets of the Madoff entities that are subject to the receivership, and to learn what we can about the operations of those entities."
"Our foundation was the lifeblood of this community," she said.
Coltin, executive director of the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation, said she spent the day at her office as a woman in mourning, taking condolence calls and trying to understand what happened.
Robert Lappin started investing with Madoff in the early 1990s and eventually entrusted him with the entirety of his family foundation.
It grew dramatically over the years, attracting investors in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
Investors are now questioning whether these paid advisers were diligent enough in investigating Madoff to ensure that their money was safe.
Every year, Madoff paid out several hundred thousand dollars to the foundation.
The business was "a giant Ponzi scheme"  "all just one big lie," the SEC documents said.
The sons confronted their father Wednesday, according to authorities, asking how the firm could pay bonuses if it couldn't pay investors.
The implosion of a Wall Street firm whose owner is accused in a $50 billion swindle left regulators scrambling to seize control of its assets Friday as dozens of investors worried that they had gone from rich to poor overnight.
Stephen A. Weiss, who said he had spoken to at least 30 of them, said some entrusted all of their savings to Madoff, who had delivered steady returns for decades.
Despite Madoff's amazingly high and consistent returns and the fact that a relatively unknown accounting firm was doing his audits, the Securities and Exchange Commission "appears to have been completely surprised," the Times wrote.
The FBI said Friday that family members turned Madoff in after he confessed his fraud to them.
Velvel said he wants to know where government regulators, as well as accountants and others at Madoff's company, were when the money was being lost.
The firm reported a drop of $2 billion in assets between September and November.
Lots of people are getting fully or partially wiped out."
"Yet it seems criminal activity has continued undetected for years."

The Julian J. Levitt Foundation, based in Texas and focused on Jewish causes, lost about $6 million.
Deborah Coltin learned Friday morning that the $8 million foundation she has led for a decade, which supported a wide range of Jewish programs on the north shore of Massachusetts, did not actually exist.
The Lappin Foundation, created "to keep our children Jewish," gave about $1.5 million to Jewish groups in 2007, including a long-standing program that has paid for about 1,800 teenagers to visit Israel.
HSBC, meanwhile, declined to confirm any relationship with the alleged fraudster.
Others belonged to clubs he was a member of, including the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida and Glen Oaks Country Club in New York.
"It made all the bloody sense in the world," he said.
Top-drawer US investors who were taken in included the former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team Norman Braman, according to news reports.
"We do not dispute his number  we just have not calculated how he made it," he said.
"We don't have anything to report to investors at this time," he said.
Where those advisers work for big institutions like Banco Santander, investors will most likely look to them, rather than to the remnants of Madoff's firm, for restitution.
But the alleged ruse was finally exposed by the global financial crisis.
Prosecutors say he claims to have acted entirely alone.
One Madoff employee said he and other workers assumed that Madoff must have a separate office elsewhere to oversee his client accounts.
"This is a major disaster for a lot of people," Velvel said in a telephone interview from his Andover, Massachusetts, office.
Marc Powers, a former SEC enforcement branch chief and head of the securities practice at Baker Hostetler, said Madoff was "a very well respected, highly regarded person" on Wall Street.
With just more than 200 employees, it was tight-knit and friendly, according to current and former employees.
Madoff is charged with stealing as much as $50 billion, in part to cover a pattern of massive losses, even as he cultivated a reputation as a financial mastermind and prominent philanthropist.
"Despite these and other red flags, hedge fund companies kept promoting Mr Madoff’s funds to other funds and individuals," the Times wrote.
"I'm wiped out," the Journal quoted Sandra Manzke, chairman of one such company, Maxam Capital Management, as saying after reporting 280 million dollars in losses.

"He was a person of superb ethics, and this has to cut him to the quick," said George L. Ball, a former executive at E. F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache Securities who knows Mr. Noel.
Outside auditors hired to inspect Madoff's operations concluded that "everything checked out," this person said.
We had no indication that we and many other firms and private investors were the victims of such a highly sophisticated, massive fraudulent scheme."
"It was all done almost in fortress fashion to prevent anyone from knowing what was going on."
Among those recruiting investors on Madoff's behalf, the Times reported, were Japan's Nomura.
"Clients know that Bernard Madoff has a personal interest in maintaining the unblemished record of value, fair-dealing, and high ethical standards that has always been the firm's hallmark."
Madoff's lawyer, Dan Horwitz, said his client was "a longstanding leader in the financial-services industry with an unblemished record" and would "fight to get through this unfortunate event."

Our funds are frozen,' " Coltin said.
"I laid off five people today," she said.

Lautenberg spokesman Scott Mulhauser says the senator was an investor in Madoff's investment fund  primarily in the form of the Lautenberg family's charitable foundation.
The key attraction, however, was Madoff's remarkably successful track record.
It destroys whatever they built up over 40 years at the hands of a person they trusted."
The SEC said it is not clear when Madoff started using new investments to create the appearance of profits.
"Mr. Madoff lured investors to entrust him with substantial sums of money  in some cases massive amounts of money  with the false promise of great interest returns," said Mark Mulholland, a New York lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against Madoff.
Firms managing money on Madoff's scale would typically have hundreds of people involved in these administrative tasks.
He is free on a $10 million bond and cannot travel far outside the New York area.
"You work all your life, you finally manage to save up something, and somebody who's entrusted with it, it turns out suddenly he's a crook.
The SEC charged in its complaint that the returns were artificial.
The huge loss comes at a time when the hedge fund industry has already been wounded by the volatile markets.
Madoff asked them to come to his apartment, saying "he wasn't sure he would be able to hold it together" at the office, the SEC said.
The epicenter of what may be the largest Ponzi scheme in history was the 17th floor of the Lipstick Building, an oval red-granite building rising 34 floors above Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.
Several weeks ago, Fairfield had halted investor redemptions at two of its other funds, citing the tough market conditions as dozens of hedge funds have done.
Associated Press writers David B. Caruso, Tom Hays and Stephen Bernard contributed to this story.
Velvel said he listened to Madoff's employees explain how the firm made profits in good times and bad through computerized trading on blue-chip stocks and options, enabling small and steady profits on scores of trades.
Indeed, over time, one Fairfield's strongest selling points for its largest fund was its access to Madoff.
"The way we understood, they never went for the big hits.
As part of the process, a team of examiners conducted personal background checks, audited brokerage records and trading reports and interviewed hedge fund executives and compliance officials.
None has admitted or denied losing money.
Friday, a federal judge placed the company in receivership at the SEC's request.
"We sincerely regret that Reichmuth Matterhorn is affected ... ," the letter said.
Madoff was gregarious and empathetic, known for visiting sick employees in their hospitals and hosting warmly generous staff parties.
The two men were very different: Madoff hailed from eastern Queens and was tied closely to the Jewish community, while Noel, a native of Tennessee, moved in the Greenwich social scene with his wife, Monica.
"They were living comfortable lives and serene retirements and by the late afternoon their lives were thrown into a spiral of horror," Weiss said.
"FGG like so many other Madoff clients was a victim of a highly-sophisticated massive fraud that escaped the detection of top institutional and private investors, industry organizations, auditors, examiners, and regulatory authorities."
If you take a percent here, a half percent there, this can add up to what Madoff was saying."
Fairfield touted its investigative skills.
