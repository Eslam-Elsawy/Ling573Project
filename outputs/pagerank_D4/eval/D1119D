Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines announced Thursday that they were withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused by parents.
Therefore, "we recommend that families be aware of these risks and not use over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children ages 5 and under," Baltimore officials said.
Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group of companies that market over-the-counter cold remedies, said the remedies had been approved by the FDA and had been used for decades by millions of Americans.
Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines announced Thursday that they were withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused.
Major makers of over-the-counter infant cough and cold medicines announced Thursday that they were voluntarily withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused by parents.
The president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents companies that sell over-the-counter cold drugs, noted that the medicines had FDA approval and had been used for decades.
The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under 6.
The withdrawal comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under 6.
Popular medicines like Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds, which are marketed for use in children as young as 2, should not be given to young children under any circumstances, the petition says.
Most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines have been insufficiently tested in children, said Ganley, the director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products.
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified, particularly in infants," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade association.
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified, particularly in infants," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade association.
There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products.
There are roughly 800 over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold products.
In fact, the labels of every cough and cold remedy already caution parents to do just that, said Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents makers of over-the-counter, or OTC, medicines.
Ganley, of the FDA, said most over-the-counter cold and cough medicines had not been tested adequately in children.
Safety experts for the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency on Friday to consider an outright ban on over-the-counter, multi-symptom cough and cold medicines for children under 6.
The recall comes two months after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public health advisory warning parents not to give cough and cold medications to children under 2 years of age without a doctor's direction.
Common children's cold and cough medicines are coming under scrutiny from federal drug regulators, who say the remedies and their recommended doses have not been studied enough in children, a newspaper reported.
In the case of pediatric over-the-counter medicines, the agency decided decades ago that drug makers could market the medicines for children even though they had only been tested in adults.
The pediatricians who petitioned the FDA Thursday acknowledged that children's cold medicines were generally safe in recommended doses, but they said overdoses were common because many children were given more than one medicine, among other reasons.
The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an industry trade group that has consistently defended the safety of pediatric cough and cold medicines, recommended in its own 156-page safety review, also released Friday, that the FDA consider mandatory warning labels saying that they should not be used in children younger than two.
Its comments came in response to a petition filed Thursday by a group of prominent pediatricians and public health officials demanding that the agency stop drug makers from marketing cold and cough medicines for children under 6.
"The reason the makers of over-the-counter, oral cough and cold medicine for infants are withdrawing these medicines is that there have been rare patterns of misuse leading to overdose recently identified, particularly in infants, and safety is our top priority," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the trade association.
Despite this recommendation, makers continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.
The move comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over-the-counter cough and cold products for children under the age of 6.
There is little evidence that cough and cold medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.
The pediatricians who petitioned the drug agency acknowledged that children's cough and cold medicines were generally safe when given in recommended doses.
A group of pediatricians and public health officials asked the agency Thursday to bar drug manufacturers from marketing such remedies as Toddler's Dimetapp, Infant Triaminic and Little Colds to children under 6.
There is very little evidence that cough and cold medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.
The industry said that the medicines are safe and effective when used as directed.
The reviewers wrote that there is little evidence that these medicines are effective in young children, and there are increasing fears that they may be dangerous.
If other medicines, whether over-the-counter or prescription, are being given to a child, the child's health care provider should review and approve their combined use.
The experts will also consider whether children from 2 to 6 should be given these medicines.
The experts will also consider whether children from 2 to 6 should be given these medicines.
member companies are currently marketing these products for use in children under 2."
Products aimed at children under the age of 2 are being removed from store shelves due to "rare instances of misuse" that could lead to accidental overdose, a trade group that represents over-the-counter drug makers said.
Concentrated Tylenol Plus Cold Cough, for instance, includes a picture of a mother and infant, even though its label recommends asking a doctor before using in children younger than 2.
With almost no evidence that they are effective and growing worries that they may be unsafe, a group of prominent pediatricians petitioned the agency earlier this year to consider banning the drugs' use in young children.
Despite the industry's recommendation, many companies  including such giants as Johnson Johnson  continue to sell cough and cold medicines with "infant" in their titles and pictures of babies on their labels.
Late last month, the Food and Drug Administration tentatively recommended adding labeling to the medicines indicating they are not to be used for young children.
U.S. government health officials said Friday they are reviewing whether popular medicines like Tylenol Plus Cold Cough and Infant Triaminic Thin Strips are safe and effective in treating children's colds and coughs.
The official, Dr. Charles J. Ganley, director of the office of nonprescription drug products at the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview that the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children" and that "we're particularly concerned about the use of these drugs in children less than 2 years of age."
Mark Boston, a spokesman for a Johnson Johnson subsidiary that sells pediatric cough and cold medicines, said the company "supports the materials" that the trade association submitted to the FDA, but declined to say why the company continues to sell such products as "Concentrated Tylenol Infants' Drops Plus Cold."
Federal drug regulators have started a broad review of the safety of popular cough and cold remedies meant for children, a top official said Thursday.
The petition followed a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that more than 1,500 children under the age of two had suffered serious health problems between 2004 and 2005 after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.
In rare cases, children have had medical problems after taking recommended doses, the article said.
Cold medicines being withdrawn include Johnson Johnson Pediacare Infant Drops and Tylenol Concentrated Infants Drops, Wyeth's Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops, Novartis' Triaminic Infant Toddler Thin Strips and Prestige Brands Holdings' Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough.
They also questioned the drugs' effectiveness in children.
A recent study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that more than 1,500 children under 2 had experienced serious health problems  and three died  after taking common cold medicines in 2004 and 2005.
In a recent study of hospital emergency room records from 2004 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that at least 1,519 children who were 2 years old had suffered serious health problems after being treated with common cough and cold medicines.
Even the industry's main trade group, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks ago that the products not be used on infants.

In rare cases, children have been injured even when given recommended doses.
"These products are used by hundreds of thousands of kids every year, but no one can say that they're safe or effective," he said.
"We believe that companies should also stop marketing cough and cold products for toddlers," Sharfstein said.
"So many people use these products even though they have no effect on colds and there's a real risk of a problem," said an author of the petition, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a pediatrician and the health commissioner of Baltimore.
"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children," Ganley said.
Infant cough-and-cold products were approved decades ago without adequate testing in children because experts assumed that children were simply small adults, and that drugs approved for adults must also work in children.
Dimetapp and Robitussin are products of Little Colds is made by the Medtech Products unit of Prestige Brands Tylenol and Pediacare are made by the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of Johnson and Triaminic is made by Novartis.
And some small companies could continue selling infant products.
And some small companies could continue selling infant products.
Johnson Johnson on Thursday voluntarily recalled certain infant cough and cold products, citing "rare" instances of misuse leading to overdoses.
Also on Friday, the FDA warned the makers of nearly 200 unapproved prescription medicines containing the pain-and-cough-relief drug hydrocodone that by Oct. 31 they must stop making these products for children under six.
Murphy of the FDA said parents should be more cautious about using such medicines.
Consumers should take only the recommended doses, Suydam said.
Even the industry's own trade association, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, recommended two weeks ago that the products should no longer be used for infants.
Current figures on the medicines' sales and use are not available, but in 1994 researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association that more than a third of all three-year-olds in the United States were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.
Do not use cough and cold products in children under 2 unless given specific directions to do so by a health care provider.
Joshua M. Sharfstein, the Baltimore commissioner of health, cheered the withdrawals but said that the FDA should ban all such products so that smaller companies do not continue to sell them.
The FDA has never approved dosing recommendations for the 0-2 age group for the drugs.
The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for "infants," not those for use in children 2 and older.
Cough and cold products for children age 2 and over and single-ingredient pain reliever and fever reducers expressly labeled for infants are not included in the recall.
Next week, a committee of outside experts will meet to consider the safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the agency.
Amid questions about benefits and risks, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday its Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee will meet Oct. 18-19 to discuss the use of cough and cold drugs by children.
A 1994 study found that more than a third of all 3-year-olds in the country were given over-the-counter cough and cold preparations in one 30-day span.
But there are a growing number of reports that even children given recommended doses are at risk.

Drug makers on Thursday voluntarily pulled kids' cold medicines off the market less than two weeks after the U.S. government warned of potential health risks to infants.
The FDA issued a public health advisory that cited serious adverse effects linked to children  particularly those 2 and younger  who have received too great a dose of over-the-counter medications for coughs and colds.
"We have been looking at this issue internally with regard to the safety and efficacy of the use of these products in children," Dr. Charles Ganley, director of the FDA's office of nonprescription drug products, told reporters as he responded to a petition filed Thursday by city of Baltimore officials and others.
The products being withdrawn include Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops and Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops, both made by Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, by Prestige Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant and Tylenol Concentrated Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough, both by Johnson and Triaminic Infant Toddler Thin Strips Decongestant, by Novartis.
The recommendation, in a 356-page safety review, is the clearest signal yet that the agency may take strong action against the roughly 800 popular medicines marketed in the United States under names like Toddler's Dimetapp, Triaminic Infant and Little Colds.
Despite the recommendation, giant drugmakers like Johnson Johnson, Wyeth and Novartis continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.
Despite the recommendation, giant drugmakers like Johnson Johnson, Wyeth and Novartis continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants.
Parents should carefully follow directions for use that come with a medication, the FDA said.
In the new safety review, the FDA's experts suggested that all "infant" cough and cold formulations be removed from the market, and that the droppers, cups and syringes included with products for children be standardized to reduce the risks of confusion and overdose.
They should be taken only in recommended doses, association president Linda A. Suydam said.
The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia recently reported on four cases of prolonged hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended doses of the medicines.
A 1994 study found that during one 30-day span, more than a third of the nation's 3-year-olds were estimated to have been given over-the-counter cough and cold remedies.
The U.S. government is warning parents not to give cough and cold medicines to children under 2 without a doctor's order, part of an overall review of the products' safety and effectiveness for youngsters.
Current labeling directs parents to consult a doctor before administering the drugs to infants and toddlers, and many doctors say they are safe to use.
Many cold and cough drugs won FDA approval decades ago, when the agency's standards were less strict, The Times reported.
The products being recalled include infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Concentrated Infants' Tylenol Drops Plus Cold Pediacare Infant Drops Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant Pediacare Infant Dropper Pediacare Infant Dropper Long-Acting and Pediacare Infant Dropper Decongestant Cough (PE) products.
Most have been around for decades, and the FDA is gradually forcing their makers to either get official approval or stop selling them.
There are thousands of such unapproved drugs on the market.
Next week, a committee of outside experts will consider the safety of these medicines and offer recommendations to the agency.

Children's Vicks NyQuil has a cartoon that shows a small, sleeping child hugging a sleeping puppy.
Little Colds has a cartoon of a cheerful, crawling infant wearing only a diaper.
Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.
Yet these products have never been proven to benefit children so young, the petitioners argued.
Still, product packaging often bears images of children apparently much younger than 2, as well as terms like "infant" and "baby."
Most major pharmacies carry a dozen or more brands.
Overdoses can also result when frantic parents try to shove eyedroppers or cups of medicine into the mouths of crying, spitting babies.
Johnson Johnson does not report overall Tylenol sales but has hinted that they approach $1 billion annually.
For liquid products, parents should use the measuring device that is packaged with each medicine formulation and is marked to deliver the recommended dose.
From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children died in the United States after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, according to the FDA.
The doses recommended on many of the products' labels were no better than educated guesses, he said.
The FDA said it could not yet determine whether new regulations would result from the safety review, according to the newspaper.
Until Thursday, industry representatives answered that they were discussing the issue with the FDA and defended their medicines as safe and effective.

In a statement, JnJ's McNeil-PPC unit said the misuse could lead to overdoses "particularly in infants under two years of age."
The agency's safety review and its decision to ban unapproved hydrocodone products both result from gradual but significant changes in the standards used for drug approvals.
And some small companies may continue selling the products.
Dr. Charles J. Ganley, a top Food and Drug Administration official, said the agency was "revisiting the risks and benefits of the use of these drugs in children," especially those under 2, The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
The Poison Control Center of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia recently reported four cases of prolonged hallucinations in children as old as 6 who were given recommended doses.
In Baltimore, the medical examiner has linked the products to the deaths of at least four children under 4 in the last five years.
After reviewing reports of side effects over the last four decades, FDA found 54 child fatalities from over-the-counter decongestant medicines.
The petition says that the medicines do not work and that in rare cases they can cause serious injury.
Like hundreds of older drugs, many of the medicines in these products do not get a thorough safety review by the FDA.
But according to a growing number of studies in children, the drugs are no better than placebos.
"OTC cough and cold remedies have a long history of safety when used according to the label.
Dianne Murphy, director of the agency's office of pediatric therapeutics, said in an interview that in addition to asking basic questions about the drugs' safety and effectiveness, the agency intended to question the experts closely about the advisability of combination medicines.
Dianne Murphy, director of the agency's office of pediatric therapeutics, said in an interview that in addition to asking basic questions about the drugs' safety and effectiveness, the agency intended to question the experts closely about the advisability of combination medicines.
"All drugs have risks," she said, "and these drugs are mostly used to treat symptoms and not the underlying disease, and we need to be very careful about deciding whether and when to use them or not."
Among the products being withdrawn are Dimetapp Decongestant Infant Drops, Little Colds Decongestant Plus Cough, Pediacare Infant Drops Decongestant, Robitussin Infant Cough DM Drops, Triaminic Infant and Toddler Thin Strips Decongestant, and Tylenol Concentrated Infant Drops Plus Cold and Cough.

Do not give children medicine that is packaged and made for adults.
The review covers medicines that include decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants and expectorants.
Sharfstein said there was now enough evidence about the dangers of the drugs for the FDA to act.
Many cough and cold medicines now advise parents to "consult a physician" before use in such children.
Indeed, a growing number of studies suggest that cough and cold medicines work no better in children than placebos.
The petition noted that in 1990, Americans spent nearly $2 billion on these medications, and it said that in a typical drugstore, over 30 separate cough and cold preparations are marketed to parents for use in children.
The most important information for all consumers is that OTC medicines are real medicines and must be used according to the label instructions at all times," Suydam said in a statement.
The petition asks the FDA to go further and require that labels say the products shouldn't be used to treat children younger than 6.
"We have no data on these agents of what's a safe and effective dose in children," he told The Times in an interview.
Despite this, there are 800 such products on the market and sales have long been strong.
There are seven FDA-approved prescription cough products containing hydrocodone, and doctors can continue to write prescriptions for those.
The next step in the process will be a meeting of outside experts on Oct. 18-19 to examine the medicines' safety and offer recommendations to the agency.
Use only products marked for use in babies, infants or children, sometimes called "pediatric" use.
In the fiscal year that ended July 15, makers sold at least 41 million units of these products in the United States, about a fifth of which were sold in the form of drops that are generally given to infants, according to the trade association.
Last year, the American College of Chest Physicians recommended that parents avoid using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones, because the medicines can cause serious problems.
Indeed, recent studies suggest that pediatric cough and cold medicines work no better than placebos.
The market for these medicines is fed by parents looking for anything to get their children to sleep peacefully.
The American College of Chest Physicians last year recommended avoiding using cough and cold medicines in children, especially young ones.
The study's authors told parents to consult a doctor before giving the remedies to children under age 2.
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group and a longtime critic of the FDA, noted that cold medicines have a troubled history.
Most of these drugs have been around for decades and were approved for sale by the FDA when standards were far lower than they are today.The agency has put all the compounds on a "monograph," which means that drug manufacturers can use and combine them in pills and syrups without doing any of the expensive and lengthy studies that would be needed for a new drug.
Many of these children were injured after their parents mistakenly gave them too much, either because they did not realize that products from two different makers contained identical medicine, or the parents measured doses poorly.
From 1969 to 2006, at least 45 children died after taking decongestants, and 69 died after taking antihistamines, the industry association has said.
The medicines are popular largely because children have an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.
In the year prior to July 15, makers sold at least 41 million packages of these in the United States, according to the healthcare products group, about a fifth of which were sold in the form of "drops" that are generally targeted for use in infants.
"Parents will do anything for their kids," said Sharfstein.
Manufacturer McNeil Consumer Healthcare reiterated that advice in a statement.
More changes, perhaps mandated by federal drug regulators, could be in the offing.
More changes, perhaps mandated by federal drug regulators, could be in the offing.
Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's commissioner of health and an author of a petition that led the FDA to conduct its current review, cheered its new report, saying it raised serious questions about why anyone would give cough and cold medicines to young children.
Other recommendations in the advisory included:
"There is widespread consensus that there is no good evidence for the effectiveness of several of the compounds used in cold medicines," said Dr. Ian M. Paul, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine who has studied the medicines.
Similarly, hydrocodone has never been shown to be safe and effective in children, and its dangers as a powerful and potentially addictive narcotic are clear.
"There is this incredible disparity between how the products are regulated and what the scientific evidence and consensus states," Sharfstein said.
Those critics, including public health officials and pediatricians, are pushing the government for stricter warnings to prevent life-threatening overdoses.
Three of the children died, the disease control agency found.
And just two months ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 1,500 toddlers and babies wound up in emergency rooms over a two-year period because of the drugs.
"The FDA should be first to act to ensure consumer safety rather than leaving families to rely on the industry itself," Schumer said.
In above-normal doses, cold medicines can lead to heart arrhythmias, and some have been linked to hypertension and stroke when taken in high doses, The Times reported.
Given such problems, Wolfe said, the agency years ago should have taken a closer look at all common cold medicines.
Dr. Andrew D. Racine, a pediatrician at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, said that most parents who give cold medicines to young children were just hoping for a good night's sleep themselves.
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for Wyeth, which makes Toddler's Dimetapp, agreed, adding that "parents of children under the age of 2 are encouraged to seek the advice of a physician before administering any over-the-counter medicine."
But they added that overdoses were common, for a variety of reasons.
Companies would not disclose sales figures for the products.
Many children sickened after they were mistakenly given too much  either because parents failed to realize that products from two makers contained identical medicines or because parents had given improper amounts.
Cough and cold medicines come in different strengths.
None of the companies' stocks moved significantly on by midafternoon Novartis and Johnson Johnson were trading slightly higher, and Wyeth and Prestige Brands slightly lower.
The FDA will formally consider revising labeling at a meeting scheduled for Oct. 18-19.
The agency found 69 reports of children's deaths connected with antihistamines, which are used to treat runny noses.
Children suffer an average of six to 10 colds each year, far more than adults.
Last week, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to the industry's trade association asking why the products were still being sold.

The petitioners called that misleading, adding that the average drug store stocks more than 30 such products.
Racine said that he tells all new parents never to combine cough and cold medicines and to expect that their child will get six to eight colds each year.
Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used to treat pain and suppress cough.
Despite these growing worries, sales of the drugs are booming.
Even more broadly, 200 hydrocodone-containing products never won approval from the modern-day FDA.
Such cautions "are clearly stated in product labeling," Petkus said.
Makers of all other unapproved hydrocodone products have until Dec. 31 to stop making them.
A kitchen teaspoon or tablespoon is not an appropriate measuring device.
The petition is far from the first warning about children using the medicines.

"I don't recommend their use in any child," said Dr. Daniel Frattarelli, a pediatrician from Detroit who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on drugs.
Because the drugs are so widely available, there is no incentive for drug manufacturers to perform such studies.

In Maryland alone, roughly 900 children 4 and younger overdosed on the medicines in 2004, according to the new petition.
Doug Petkus, a Wyeth spokesman, said the withdrawals would "have minimal impact on the company."
In high doses, cold medicines can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to arrhythmias.
More recent research showed that neither assumption was true.
The products' labels and advertising strongly suggest that they work, many with flavors like grape and cherry.
And it added that since adverse drug reactions are reported voluntarily and fitfully, the numbers were likely to significantly understate the medicines' true toll.
"They will buy expensive syrups if they think their kid will do better."
If unsure about the right product for a child, ask a health care provider.
A decade ago, many such medicines contained phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, until studies showing that it could cause hemorrhagic stroke led the FDA to ban it.
Disclosure of the review, which will take months to complete, came as critics charged that many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies can harm toddlers and preschoolers.
"Safety is our top priority," Suydam added.
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the drug agency for a delayed withdrawal.
Most cough and cold concoctions have nasal decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants or expectorants  common ingredients with names like dextromethorphan, guaifenesin and phenylephrine.
Information about their lack of efficacy and worrisome side effects have trickled out.
"When you become a parent," he said, "you have to be prepared for some sleepless nights."
A spokeswoman declined to comment further.
The proposed warnings "are recommendations that we have brought forth and we look forward to having a thorough discussion with the FDA," said Virginia Cox, a spokeswoman for the trade group.
The safety problems might be worth risking, the petitioners said, if the medicines worked to suppress coughs or clear stuffy noses.
It promises that it "safely and gently relieves."
