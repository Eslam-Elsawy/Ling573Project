The tanker, which is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is one of the largest ships to sail the seas.
  Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a regional maritime official said on Monday.
Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
A hijacked Saudi-owned supertanker carrying more than $100 million worth of crude oil was anchored off the coast of Somalia on Tuesday, and the ship's owner said it was working to free the ship and its 25-member crew.
The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
The U.S. Navy said the MV Sirius Star was seized far off the coast of Kenya on Saturday and that the bandits were taking the ship to a Somali port known as a hub of pirate activity.
Vela, the ship's owner and operator, is one of the largest crude oil tanker companies in the world.
Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil supertanker loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
Pirates have seized control of the Saudi-owned super tanker Sirius Star off the east coast of Africa and are taking it towards a Somali port, the US Navy said on Monday.
The supertanker, about the same length as an American Nimitz class aircraft carrier, is the largest ship known to have been seized by pirates, and it was fully loaded with 2 million barrels of oil.
Reports from the U.S. Navy said the tanker, Sirius Star, operated by Vela International, was hijacked after a group of pirates managed to scale the 10-meter high side of the ship.
The U.S. Navy said the Saturday's hijacking of the oil tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
Christensen said the pirates hijacked the vessel on Saturday.
The owner of a Saudi oil supertanker hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend said the 25 crew members are safe and the ship is fully loaded with crude  a cargo worth about $100 million at current prices.
According to the US navy, the tanker  which is as big as three soccer fields  is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.

Sirius Star, which is owned by Saudi Aramco, carried 25 crew members from Croatia, Britain, Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia, according to a US Navy statement.
The pirates were taking the captured tanker and crew to anchor off the Somali port of Eyl, said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the Navy's 5th Fleet.
The Sirius Star, which was commissioned in March and is owned by the Saudi oil company Aramco, is classed as a Very Large Crude Carrier, the second-largest classification.

The Saudi tanker was the largest ship taken.
Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year.
The tanker, owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is 330 meters (1,080 feet), about the length of an aircraft carrier.
The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates, though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been hijacked.
This year, 92 ships have been attacked in and around the Gulf of Aden, more than triple the number in 2007, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
Christensen said the Sirius Star was carrying crude, but he could not say how much.
"All 25 crew members on board are reported to be safe.
On Tuesday, the super-tanker, carrying 100 million dollars of oil, was anchored off the Somali piracy hub port of Haradhere.
The brand new MV Sirius Star tanker, with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m. Saturday more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the U.S. Navy said.
It was the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck.
It was the largest vessel seized yet in a surge of pirate attacks, and the farthest out to sea that the well-armed fighters, bolstered by millions in past ransoms, have successfully struck.
The International Maritime Bureau has reported that at least 83 ships have been attacked off Somalia since January, of which 33 were hijacked.
The area lies far south of the zone where warships have increased their patrols this year in the Gulf of Aden, one of the busiest channels in the world, leading to and from the Suez Canal, and the scene of most past attacks.

Dubai-based Vela International Marine Ltd., a subsidiary of Saudi oil company Aramco, said in a statement Monday that company response teams have been set up and are working to ensure the release of the crew and the vessel.
The owner, Vela International, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia-based oil giant Saudi Aramco, said in a statement that the company was awaiting further contact from the pirates who seized the vessel about 480 miles off the coast of Somalia.
Lieutenant Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said the hijacking was shocking because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom- hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.
The International Maritime Bureau has reported that at least 92 ships have been attacked off Somalia since January, of which 36 were hijacked.
Pirates have been spreading their attacks in recent weeks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that would be extremely difficult and costly to patrol, maritime security experts said.
He said such vessels typically have an armed security contingent on board but could not say if that was the case with the Sirius Star.
Christensen said the Sirius Star was carrying crude, but could not say how much.
A British Foreign Office spokesman said there were at least two British nationals aboard the MV Sirius Star, but said he could offer no further details on the ship or what had happened to it.
The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag and its 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
"It seems the vessel was hijacked on Saturday because the ship is approaching anchorage off the port of Eyl in Somalia.
Including the Sirius Star, Vela owns and operates a fleet of 19 vessels classed as Very Large Crude Oil Carriers.
Christensen said he had no details on the ship's port of origin and destination.
Christensen said he had no details on the ship's port of origin and destination.
Earlier reports had said that the 1,080-foot-long ship, Sirius Star, had been hijacked off the Kenyan coast.
It is "the largest pirated vessel in the region" to date, Christensen said.
"It's the largest ship we've seen hijacked and one attacked farthest out on the sea," Christensen said.

Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year as bandits have become bolder, better armed and capable of operating hundreds of miles from shore.
A coalition of warships from eight nations, as well as from NATO and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, is patrolling a critical zone in the Gulf of Aden leading to and from the Suez Canal.
Pirates have been spreading their attacks southward into a vast area of the Indian Ocean that is extremely difficult and costly to patrol, maritime security experts said.
"We are not in the area," the spokesman said.
The MV Sirius Star, a brand new tanker with a 25-member crew, was seized at about 10 a.m. Saturday more than 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, the Navy said.
On the Sirius Star, the attackers likely would have had to scale about 10 meters (33 feet) from the water to the deck.
The hijacking follows a string of increasingly brazen attacks by Somali pirates in recent months, but this appeared to be first time they have seized an oil tanker.
The crew members are citizens of Britain, Poland, Croatia, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.
He added that NATO played no role in response to the seizure of the oil-laden Saudi tanker, the Sirius Star, which was taken at the weekend in waters off the coast of Kenya and Tanzania.
Vela said the fully-laden tanker was seized by a group of armed men about 420 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia on Sunday.
"We remain deeply concerned because this attack represents a fundamental change in pirates' ability to hijack bigger vessels farther out at sea," Christensen said.
As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers, among the 20,000 tankers, freighters and merchant vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden each year.
The Faina and its 20-member crew are still being held off Somalia, watched by warships to prevent the removal of its cargo.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday it was monitoring the situation but didn't expect to send warships to surround the vessel as it has done with a Ukrainian ship loaded with tanks and other weaponry the was seized off the Somali coast on Sept. 25 and remains in pirate hands.
In a news release sent out on Monday from the 5th Fleet's Middle East headquarters in Bahrain, the Navy said the large crude tanker Sirius Star was attacked more than 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.

The 25-member crew includes citizens of Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
It can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
At least 14 of those ships, carrying more than 250 crew members, are still in the control of hijackers.
On the Sirius Star, the attackers likely would have had to scale about 30 feet (nine meters) from the water to the deck.
The South Korea-built ship, launched earlier this year, is operated by Vela International and registered in Liberia.
Pirate attacks off Somalia have surged more than 75 percent this year, hitting dozens of freighters, tankers, yachts and fishing vessels.
Attacks have increased more than 75 percent this year.
Pirates are well organised in the area where Somalia's northeastern tip juts into the Indian Ocean, preying on a key maritime route leading to the Suez Canal through which an estimated 30 percent of the world's oil transits.

The hijacking was alarming because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom-hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.
While most of the hijackings have taken place in the Gulf of Aden, which separates Somalia from Yemen, the Saudi tanker was seized hundreds of miles to the south in a vast stretch of open ocean as the tanker headed toward the Cape of Good Hope.
Pirate attacks off Somalia have surged more than 75 percent this year, hitting freighters, tankers, yachts and fishing vessels.
That's where most of the more than 80 attacks this year have occurred.
The risk is low and returns are extremely high.
But the pirates would have no way of selling crude and no way to refine it in Somalia.
The massive supertanker would seem to present a daunting target for the pirates, who usually operate in small speedboats.
Somalia has lacked an effective government since the 1991 ouster of president Mohamed Siad Barre touched off a bloody power struggle that has defied numerous attempts to restore stability.
The pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.
Dubbed Operation Atlanta, the mission, endorsed by the bloc's defence ministers at talks in Brussels, is being led by Britain, with its headquarters in Northwood, near London.
The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, called the hijacking "an outrageous act."
In September, three pirates in a speed boat fired machine guns at an Iranian crude oil carrier, though the ship escaped after a 30-minute chase.
The pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and GPS equipment.

In Athens, Greece, on Tuesday, he said, "Piracy, like terrorism, is a disease which is against everybody, and everybody must address it together."
Raja Kiwan, a Dubai-based analyst with PFC Energy, said the hijacking raises "some serious questions" about what is needed to secure such ships when they are on the open seas.

Pirates rarely hurt their hostages, instead holding out for a huge payday.
Fully loaded, the ship's cargo could be worth about $100 million.
NATO is considering whether to launch long-term missions to counter piracy, a spokesman said Tuesday, as pirates anchored a captured Saudi super-tanker off the coast of Somalia.
He also had no details about where the ship was sailing from and where it was headed.

As pirates have become better armed and equipped, they have sailed farther out to sea in search of bigger targets, including oil tankers.
The takeover demonstrates the bandits' heightened ambitions and capabilities: Never before have they seized such a giant ship so far out to sea.
"It had been slightly easier to get it under control in the Gulf of Aden because it is a comparatively smaller area of water which has to be patrolled, but this is huge," said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.

He would not elaborate on how the Navy was watching the hijacked tanker.
But the pirates are able to strike back: In April, they punched a hole in the side of a Japanese oil tanker with a rocket-propelled grenade in an unsuccessful attempt to capture it.
"I don't anticipate any U.S. ships on station," said Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the 5th Fleet, speaking from its headquarters in Bahrain.

It is 330 meters (1,080 feet) long, or about the length of an aircraft carrier, and can carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
If it were fully loaded, the ship's deck would be lower to the water, making it easier for pirates to climb aboard with grappling equipment and ladders, as they do in most hijackings.
The capturing of the oil tanker represents a "fundamental shift in the ability of pirates to be able to attack merchant vessels," he said.
The 318,000 deadweight tonnes Very Large Crude Carrier is the largest vessel to be seized in an epidemic of piracy in the region.
The hijacking was the latest in a surge in Somali pirate attacks this year and highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships moving through the area.
"It is very alarming," said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.
Maritime security experts said they have tracked a southward spread in piracy over the last several weeks into a vast area of the Indian Ocean, noting with alarm that the area would be almost impossible to patrol.
In a dramatic escalation of high seas crime, Somali pirates hijacked a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude oil hundreds of miles (kilometers) off the coast of East Africa  defeating the security web of warships trying to protect vital shipping lanes.
The ship was sailing under a Liberian flag.
Details of Saturday's attack were not known, but in past seizures, pirates have used ropes and ladders to climb the hull  and on large ships, the crew often does not notice them until it is too late.

In Somalia, pirates are better-funded, better-organized and better-armed than one might imagine in a country that has been in tatters for nearly two decades.
The stepped-up international presence recently also appears to have deterred several attacks.

Appathurai noted that NATO had escorted around 7,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Somalia since its operation began this month, and cited the UN World Food Programme as saying that no pirate attacks had hit its ships since.
The mission, NATO's first-ever against pirates and which is commanded from Naples, southern Italy, ends in mid-December when the bigger European Union Operation Atalanta is to be put in place.
NATO has four ships  from Britain, Greece, Italy and Turkey  on patrol in the waters off Somalia, with two protecting UN food aid convoys to the strife- torn Horn of Africa country.
Last week, the European Union started a security operation off the coast of Somalia, north of Kenya, to combat growing acts of piracy and protect ships carrying aid agency deliveries.
"There will be a second discussion in NATO referring to a potential longer-term role" in anti-piracy operations, spokesman James Appathurai told reporters in Brussels.
In October, a Spanish military patrol plane thwarted pirates trying to hijack an oil tanker by buzzing them three times and dropping smoke canisters.
Earlier this year, French commandos used night vision goggles and helicopters in operations that killed or captured several pirates, who are now standing trial in Paris.
"The EU presence will be bigger and more designed for the mission," Appathurai said, but he added that the military alliance is wondering "would anything complementary be necessary" for the EU.
