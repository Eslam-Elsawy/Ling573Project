The trial opened Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike to hit Spain.
He is charged with 191 counts of murder and 1,755 of attempted murder in the Madrid, Spain, bombings on March 11, 2004, though he has been secretly recorded saying that he had not been with the men who carried them out.
One of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings of four packed Madrid commuter trains on March 11, 2004, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias "Mohammed the Egyptian," was expected to be the first called to testify.
The suspected bombers are Jamal Zougam, a 33-year-old Moroccan who has been charged with 191 murders, 1,824 murders and membership of a terrorist organisation.
Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, an alleged mastermind of the train bombings on March 11, 2004, in Madrid, on Thursday rejected all charges against him.
Tight security was imposed Thursday for the start of the trial of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the 2004 Madrid train bomb attacks.
There is no material evidence against Egyptian Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, who goes on trial on Thursday accused of being one of the masterminds behind the deadly train bombings in Madrid on March 11, 2004, his lawyer told AFP.
Ahmed, 35, is suspected of having helped organise the bombings of four commuter trains, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824.
He is also charged with the attempted murder of 10 other police and faces 38,654 years in jail.
A 30-year-old Moroccan, he also faces the 38,656-year jail sentence.
Sayed Ahmed was arrested on June 7, 2004, in Italy.
But the man, Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed  expected to be the first of 29 defendants to take the stand when the bombing trial begins Thursday in Madrid  also said in the recordings that the attack was carried out according to his plan.
Nicknamed "Mohammed the Egyptian", he is charged with 191 murders, 1,824 attempted murders and running a terrorist organisation.
Ahmed, also known as "Mohamed the Egyptian," was accused of inciting people to carry out the deadliest al-Qaida related attacks in Europe, which killed 191 and injured about 2,000 people.
The 30-year-old former miner faces murder charges for the 191 killed, the attempted murders of the injured and is further accused of the murder of a policeman who died in the raid at Leganes.
A 43-year-old Moroccan, he faces the same charges and potential jail sentence.
Badillo and Vidal are both due to appear in court again at the separate trial of the Madrid train bombers which begins on Thursday.
Zougam is accused of being one of the men who placed the bombs which exploded aboard four packed commuter trains on the morning of March 11, 2004.
A total of 191 people died in Spain's worst terror attack.
The majority of the 29 people on trial for the blasts are Moroccan.
Ahmed was arrested on June 7, 2004, in Italy.
Spain raised the level of its terrorism alert on Tuesday as a precautionary measure ahead of the upcoming trial of suspects in the Madrid train bombings and the third anniversary of the attacks.
The proceedings began with one of the four alleged masterminds of the coordinated bombings, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, alias "Mohammed the Egyptian," rejecting all charges against him and refusing to give evidence.
They are, Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, a 35-year-old Egyptian.
Family members of the victims of the attacks which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 others, making it the worst terror strike Spain has ever known, also gathered at the high court.
Seven major suspects blew themselves up en masse in Madrid on April 3, 2004, weeks after the train bombings, as the Spanish police closed in on them.
In November, he was convicted in Milan, where he was arrested in 2004, three months after the Madrid bombings, on charges of conspiracy to participate in international terrorist activities.
He is one of seven men facing sentences of some 40,000 years each for the deaths and membership in a terrorist organisation, although under Spanish law the longest jail term anyone can actually serve is 40 years.

Among the other defendants are two of the men charged with the actual bombings: Jamal Zougam and Abdelmajid Bouchar, both Moroccan.
The trial, which is expected to hear evidence from more than 600 witnesses and last for some five months before an October verdict, opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid.
Three of the four alleged masterminds of the bombings will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj, alias "the Afghan" and Hassan el-Haski, alias "Abu Hamza."
The trial, which opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid, is expected to hear evidence from some 600 witnesses and around 100 experts, and to last some five months before an October verdict.
Here in Italy, he was given a 10-year sentence, which he is appealing.
Like Ahmed  considered an "intellectual author" of the bombings  two other defendants are considered ideological planners: Hassan el-Haski, a Moroccan who was the leader of a group also accused of carrying out a deadly bombing in Casablanca, Morocco, in and Youssef Belhadj, also Moroccan, who was arrested in Brussels, Belgium, in 2005.
He was temporarily extradited to Spain but sent back to Milan and sentenced last November to 10 years in jail for "criminal association for purposes of international terrorism", before being returned to Spain.

Sarhane ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, alias "the Tunisian," who prosecutors believe "led and coordinated" the attacks, was one of seven men who died after blowing themselves up during a police raid on an apartment in the Madrid suburb of Leganes three weeks after the attacks.
He is the cousin of Mohamed Belhadj, who rented an apartment in the Madrid suburb of Leganes, where seven men blew themselves up during a police raid three weeks after the bombings.
Media, survivors and relatives of the victims will be able to watch via closed circuit television in different rooms, although a handful of seats in the 180-seat courtroom have been reserved for the public.
He constantly moved around Europe, living in Germany, Spain, France and Italy since 1999.
During his nine-month trial in Milan, prosecutors presented evidence portraying Ahmed as a dedicated warrior, providing a window into the workings and motivations of suspected terrorist cells.
Extra police and soldiers will guard crowded areas such as shopping centres and transport hubs as well as the water supply and power plants while the heightened alert level is in place.
At another point, he told Ragheh that he must join al-Qaida "to make jihad," according to his interpretation of the Quran.
"I don't recognise any of the accusations or any of the denunciations," he said when appearing at a heavily-guarded courtroom.
At the start of a trial laden with anger and unresolved grief, Spanish officials and news media have focused on Ahmed, a man with a well-documented legal trail.
"I wanted to plan it so it would be something unforgettable, including myself because I was ready to blow myself up.
A just-released report by psychiatrists and social workers involved with helping the survivors and relatives overcome their trauma showed that almost one in five survivors have not been on a train since.
Dozens of survivors and relatives of the victims will follow the proceedings on the spot, some in the courtroom itself but mostly from a separate room where they will watch on a flatscreen.
"They have always believed in their nuclear arms and their power, but with the might of God and faith, we will win."
"The time has come for our war," he told Ragheh in one intercepted conversation.
Police and soldiers will guard crowded areas such as shopping centers, transport hubs and sports complexes, as well as emblematic areas or buildings, the water supply and power plants, the statement said.
The prosecution says the "final detonator" for the train bombings was a message broadcast by Arab television channel Al-Jazeera on October 18, 2003, from Al- Qaeda's fugitive leader Osama bin Laden naming Spain as a potential target.

Luca D'Auria, his defense lawyer in Italy and in Spain, said that as much as Ahmed talked, no direct link from him to the bombers was proved.
Three of the four will be in the dock: Ousmane, Youssef Belhadj, alias "the Afghan" and Hassan el-Haski, alias "Abu Hamza."
The blasts on four packed commuter trains were the biggest in the Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
The four alleged masterminds spent a year planning the worst terror attack in Europe since the December 1988 bombing of a PanAm jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people.
If convicted, Ahmed, 35, faces prison time that could total nearly 40,000 years, but under Spanish law, he would not serve more than 40 years.
Ghalyoun is said to have been closely linked to Serhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, one of the seven who blew themselves up in the police raid.
There are only two recordings from Milan where he talks about Madrid," said Italian Luca D'Auria, one of two lawyers representing Ahmed, nicknamed "Mohammed the Egyptian".
The three alleged bombers and the Spaniard who has been accused of supplying the explosives from a disused mine in exchange for drugs will also be in the dock.
He was extradited to Spain in mid-November.
All those on trial will give evidence from a bullet-proof box at the venue.

Twenty Arab men and nine Spaniards face charges that range from belonging to a terrorist group to stealing dynamite to sell to the bombers as the trial opens weeks before the third anniversary of the March 11 bombings.
Seven men who "led and coordinated" the attacks blew themselves up in a police raid three weeks later.
Over 1,000 people, police, family members of the victims, lawyers, and journalists from around the world are expected at the court for the first day of the trial.
The trial will get underway from 10 am (0900 GMT) amid ultra-tight security at the high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid, and is expected to last some six months.
"There is no evidence against him ...
Apart from the accusations that Ahmed has ties to the Madrid bombers, court papers here say that he was also in contact with a group in the Netherlands linked to the killing of the film director Theo van Gogh later in 2004.
Bouchar was arrested in Montenegro on June 23, 2005, for breaking immigration laws after being found to be holding an Iraqi passport and was extradited to Spain three months later.
Arrested on February 1, 2005, in Belgium, Belhadj was extradited the following April.
He was arrested on December 21, 2004, for presumed membership of the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group (GICM), an Al-Qaeda affiliate believed to have conceived the bombings.
Hassan Al Haski, alias "Abu Hamza," is also accused of planning the blasts.
The prosecution has identified six as the chief plotters behind Spain's worst ever militant attack.
Among them was Sarhane ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, known as the Tunisian, who has been identified as the operational mastermind of the bombings.
Another alleged bomber was Abdelmajid Bouchar, a 24-year-old Moroccan.
"There are people who have gone to jail, there are people who have died, all for God."
The prosecution alleges that the March 11 attacks, which left more than 1,800 injured, were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al- Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq.
Spain's Interior Ministry said in a statement the level of alert had been raised to the medium level of 2 from low and would stay there "to guarantee the full safety of citizens ahead of the start of the March 11 trial and the third anniversary of the attacks,"
Nicknamed "the Zebra", he fled just before police raided the flat where seven top suspects blew themselves up.
More than 600 witnesses and 107 experts have been called to testify in what prosecutors claim was an Al-Qaeda-inspired attack by radical Islamists in retribution for Spain's participation in the US-led interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
A third ETA member, Benat Barrondo, was jailed for five years for collaborating with a terrorist group.
Dozens of police were deployed at the high-security court on the outskirts of Madrid, while a helicopter flew overhead.
The two men were jailed for belonging to a terrorist group, conspiring to commit terrorist offences and illegally transporting explosives.
My stomach is churning," said a tearful Manjon, who briefly addressed reporters and emotionally embraced her lawyer before heading into court.
My stomach is churning," said Pilar Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who chairs a victim support association.
"It's going to be difficult to look in the eye those who destroyed my life but I will do it for my son," said Pilar Manjon, a woman who lost her son in the attacks and who chairs a victim support association.
"It will be difficult to look into the eyes of those who destroyed my life, but I am going to do it for my son," she added with tears in her eyes as she arrived at the court, falling in the arms of her lawyer.
"This does not appear to me to be resounding evidence against him," the lawyer said, adding that "It will be up to the public prosecutor to explain where the evidence lies."
"I am the thread behind the Madrid plot," Ahmed, an Egyptian militant, told a prospective suicide bomber in a bugged house in Milan, Italy, in May 2004.
The accused were to give evidence from a bullet-proof box.
Youssef Belhadj, alias "the Afghan," is the third accused logistical planner.
Spain, which has three security levels, had previously been on level one, described as a low terrorism alert.
The men have been called as defence witnesses for one of the accused, Moroccan national Jamal Zougam.
People on some of the "trains of death" say they remember seeing Zougam, previously said by anti-terrorist judge Baltasar Garzon to have links with a Spanish Al-Qaeda cell accused of aiding in the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
Spain raised its anti-terrorist alert to medium from low on Tuesday in advance of the trial and ahead of the third anniversary of the attacks.
The attacks, which the prosecution alleges were the work of mainly Moroccan Islamic extremists inspired by Al-Qaeda and angered by Spanish military participation in Iraq, were the biggest in the Western world since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
The first defendants arrived in two vans led by a police car with sirens wailing.
The trial is expected to wrap up in July with a verdict expected in October.
"My legs are shaking, I am scared, my stomach is churning," said Pilar Manjon, the head of a victims association, who lost her 20-year-old sone in the attacks.
The conversations caught on tape by Italian intelligence services in no way constituted "claiming responsibility right after the attack," D'Auria said, pointing out that Ahmed had told someone else in the room: "look, that thing there, I was the one who did it."
In addition, he was accused of grooming Yahia Ragheh, his co-defendant in the trial here, to become a suicide bomber to be smuggled into Syria.
Accounts of secret recordings of Ahmed and other evidence released after the Rome trial suggest that Muslim militants were highly mobile and in frequent contact with one another, discussing not only attacks in Europe but also recruitment for suicide bombers in Iraq.
All those on trial will give evidence from a bullet-proof box.
Basel Ghalyoun, a Syrian who turns 27 on February 25, is also accused of being a bomber.
Although neither an alleged planner or an alleged bomber, Spaniard Jose Emilio Suarez Trashorras faces the most charges as a suspected supplier of explosives in exchange for drugs.
The three bombers placed bags packed with some 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds) of explosives on four commuter trains during the busy morning rush hour, then left and activated the devices by mobile telephone.
The accused were brought to the venue in two armoured police vans, which arrived with sirens wailing.
Two members of Basque separatist group ETA arrested while transporting half a tonne of explosives to Madrid just prior to the March 2004 bombings Monday received jail sentences of 22 years each.
The other accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including collaboration with a terrorist group.
The others accused will stand trial for lesser offences, including collaboration with a terrorist group and falsifying documents.
He added that the plotters of the Madrid bombings who died  not the victims  "purified our hearts."
Arrested on March 19, 2004, Zougam owned a mobile phone shop in Madrid's high- immigrant district of Lavapies.
He was not charged on that occasion but Morocco told Spain in 2003 that Zougam was "particularly dangerous".
"Mohammed the Egyptian" is alleged to have boasted in intercepted telephone calls that the whole Madrid operation was "my idea."
The Italian judges deemed Ahmed to be "an influential member of Al-Qaeda".
"This case is the first to show a clear link between terrorists prepared to carry out suicide missions in Iraq as well as in Europe," a senior Italian investigator said.
Bouchar's fingerprints were found at a Madrid house where the bombs were put together and investigators say he took supplies to the Leganes seven.
The accused were brought successively in armoured police vans, which arrived with sirens wailing.
Squadrons of police were outside the court, many of them armed, others with dogs, while a helicopter flew overhead.

Victim groups say they hope the trial, whose verdict is due in October, will finally enable them to turn the page."
The court will hold three days of sessions per week through to July with a verdict due in October.
Prosecutors convinced a panel of judges that those activities included strong links with the Madrid bombers.
But since Ahmed's arrest, questions have hovered about whether he was a dangerous operative or something of a braggart puffed up by too much time spent on violent jihadist Web sites.
He said he only wished that he himself had been graced with death that day.
In his charge sheet drawn up 10 months ago, examining magistrate Juan del Olmo attributed the attacks to the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group, a North African Al- Qaeda offshoot.
The then conservative government initially blamed ETA for the train blasts, even as evidence emerged suggesting radical Muslims were to blame.
"It's a precautionary measure to guarantee normality.
Prosecutors alleged Irkus Badillo and Gorka Vidal wanted to "sow panic" in Madrid after being caught in possession of 500 kilogrammes (1,100 pounds) of explosives, and had called on the high court to hand down 29-year sentences.
In all, his hatred of the West and his willingness to use violence in the name of God against it are a recurring theme in the transcripts.
Spain is under no terrorism threat at the moment", said an Interior Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
