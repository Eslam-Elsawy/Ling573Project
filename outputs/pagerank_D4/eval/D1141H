China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area, sources with the Ministry of Water Resources said on Thursday.
The area affected by soil erosion expanded by about 15,000 sq km in China every year due to man-made factors, causing an increase of 300 million tons of soil loss annually, said E.
By the end of 2005, the region has curbed soil erosion on more than 7,400 sq km of land.
Xinjiang is blamed for nearly 30 percent of China's total acreage of soil erosion, the regional water resources administration said.
China is managing to reverse soil erosion in many areas, he said.
E said the country had reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area, by the end of 2006 as efforts to fight soil erosion paid off.
Soil erosion affects up to 73,200 square kilometers of the land Guizhou  41 percent of its total land area  but around 25,000 square kilometers have been brought under control along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River in the past few years, he said.
China's hillside farm areas lose 1.5 billion tons of soil annually, about a third of the nation's total soil loss each year, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping on Friday.
According to Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping, over-grazing, deforestation and drought are not the only tale in China's vast rural areas with the nation managing to reverse erosion in many areas and enhance water storage capacity by more than 25 billion cubic meters.
Soil conservation efforts have helped increase grain production by 18 billion kilograms a year and improved livelihoods for more than 13 million residents in areas affected by soil erosion.
At the current rate at which damaged areas are being recovered  1,000 square kilometers per year  Guizhou would need at least 70 years to bring soil erosion under control, he added.
The ministry said it published a circular to strengthen soil conservation assessment of new projects in an effort to check the erosion.
It stressed that projects that would change more than 70 percent of the natural physiognomies of an area to be developed, or damaged more than 70 percent of the plants there should fail soil conservation assessments.
Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government's conservation efforts.
Besides the natural factors, human activities are largely blamed for the deteriorating soil erosion," said an official in charge of soil conservation.
The regional water resources administration said sand sediments have taken up a third of the total storage capacity of local reservoirs and at least one third of its arable land is salinized.
Local governments have been ordered to restrict the amount of arable land that is lost to urban growth and industrialization, said the document.
Soil conservation efforts also helped increase grain production by 18 billion kilograms a year and improved livelihoods for more than 13 million residents in areas affected by soil erosion.
Erosion could wipe away more than 61,600 square kilometers of land by 2010 as China gears up economic development, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping on Friday.
"Many Tibetan agricultural communities have had their land confiscated, with minimal compensation, or have been evicted to make way for mining, infrastructure projects or urban development," the report said.
Guizhou is affected by a form of desertification called stone desertification in which soil is eroded, water levels drop, the land begins to become barren and underlying stones are exposed.
Chinese authorities explained the changes as a response to overgrazing by Tibetan herds that was causing erosion and soil loss, Human Rights Watch said.
China has about 21.3 million hectares of hillside farmland, about 18 percent of the total.
A recent national remote sensing survey shows 1.03 million sq km of land in Xinjiang suffered from soil erosion, including 20,000 sq km of the region's total 70,000 sq km of oasis.
A total of 350,000 sq km of plants and grassland have been restored and conserved.
Over the past decade, Chinese deserts expanded at a rate of 950 square miles (2,460 square kilometers) a year, according to Wang Tao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Lanzhou.
"Irrational human activities have far outpaced the government's soil conservation efforts," the official said on condition of anonymity.
Guizhou is the Chinese province suffers most from stone desertification.
Worsening stone desertification is threatening the survival of about 450,000 farmers in southwest China's Guizhou Province, and they are in dire need of being relocated, local authorities have said.
Herders have been forced to slaughter herds of yaks, sheep and goats and Communist officials have paid minimal compensation and failed to protect Tibetans' legal rights, Human Rights Watch said.
Minqin County, located between the Badain Jaran desert and the Tengger desert, has seen 94 percent of its area turn into desert as a result of years of erosion by wind and sand.
China has less than 7 percent of the world's arable land with which to feed 1.3 billion people  more than 20 percent of the world's population.
By diverting nearly 2.3 billion cubic meters of water to save the endangered vegetation along the lower reaches of the Tarim River, Xinjiang has improved the river ecology over the past six years.
About one fifth of the province's land area  35,920 square kilometers  is afflicted by karst rocky desertification, according to the Guizhou Provincial Department of Water Resources.
Soil erosion was commonly believed to be caused by economic activities that destroyed plants and failed to allow them to regenerate, as well as by natural conditions.
The most extreme efforts were in Sichuan's Golok region, where authorities banned grazing in 2003 and required herders to sell their herds and move into newly built townships, Human Rights Watch said, citing interviews with Tibetans who were affected.
But what they may face is rising food prices, and that can create political instability," he said.
The sandstorm started at 11:28 a.m., with a minimum visibility of 600 meters, and died down an hour later, according to the CMA.
"You only have to go to northwest China and see that the numbers and size of dust storms are increasing."
It even dried up in 2004 and is only about half full today.
But he appears to have met his match in the government, which already banned the use of well water for irrigation and threatened to cut the electricity ahead of the scheduled move of his village later this year to a new location about 12 miles (19 kilometers) away.
The most severe storm brought visibility down to 100 meters in April.
He also switched from wheat to less thirsty cotton and fennel.
In Dongyun village, Wei Quangcai and his deaf wife may offer a glimpse of that future.
Billboards promoting the country's one-child policy compete with those pushing slogans like "No Reclamation, No Overcultivation."
"I don't want to move," said Chen Ying, 58, sitting in a sparsely furnished bedroom dominated by a red, wall-sized poster of Mao, the communist founding father who sought to catapult Chinese farming and industry into modernity with the so-called Great Leap Forward.
The relocation program is part of a larger plan to rein in China's expanding deserts, which now cover one-third of the country and continue to grow because of overgrazing, deforestation, urban sprawl and droughts.
The shifting sands have swallowed thousands of Chinese villages along the fabled Silk Road and sparked a sharp increase in dust from China clouds the skies of South Korea and has been linked to respiratory problems in California.
His son has left for a job in Beijing over his objections.
Now, the only sounds are the wind whipping through the empty doorways.
Global warming will worsen the problem, as rising temperatures lead to widespread drought and melt most glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, depriving lakes and rivers of a crucial water source, according to the U.N.-funded Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Walking past the empty homes, Wei, 58, recalls the days when his village hummed with farmers chatting over a game of cards and the school was packed with children.
Half a century after Mao Zedong's "Great Leap Forward" brought irrigation to the arid grasslands in this remote corner of northwest China, the government is giving up on its attempt to make a breadbasket out of what has increasingly become a stretch of scrub and sand dunes.
It's the fourth consecutive year the so-called No.
Talk of the impending moves dominates the conversations of villagers, gathered around their coal-fired stoves to ward off the springtime chill.
The only signs of civilization in many areas are the herds of sheep munching on thorn bushes, the clusters of mud and straw homes and the burial mounds.
Last year, the per-capita net income of the farmers stood at 3,587 yuan (460 U.S. dollars), less than a third of those living in cities.
Throughout the province, treeless, wind-swept plains stretch for miles (kilometers) in all directions.
Other research shows that government departments have come up with emergency plans and strengthened staff training to protect the dry and vulnerable topsoil in north China.
China's foreign ministry and the local governments of Tibet and the provinces cited did not respond to requests by phone and fax for comment.
Northern China has been frequently hit by strong wind gusts.
Authorities are offering up to US$784 (euro589) per family to move 10,500 residents from Gansu Province, but the villagers don't trust the government to compensate them fairly.
Chen, a grizzled farmer who sports a Mao cap, blue coat and baggy, mud-spattered pants, has planted dozens of trees outside his home to prevent the desert dunes from overrunning his property.
The group appealed to Beijing to suspend the resettlements until a review system is put in place and to allow Tibetans to return to their land if they were forcibly moved or received no compensation.
Meanwhile, deserts are creeping at least 100 square kilometers annually in Xinjiang, it said.
E said hillside farmland had become a primary source of erosion, with about 40 to 60 kilograms of soil lost in producing a kilogram of grain on slopes on the northern Loess Plateau.
The document said the government pledges to make greater efforts to tackle serious soil erosion in areas along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers to protect the nation's limited arable land.
About 3.3 million hectares of hillside farmland were scattered along the upper Yangtze River, the Loess Plateau on the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and in northeast provinces.
Over more than half a million sq km of land hillsides have been set aside for afforestation or pastures closed to farmers.
E said the situation had deteriorated as the country stepped up urbanization and industrialization.
The government also vows to use organic fertilizers and build more water conservation projects.
The ministry has banned farming and forestry projects on all hillsides at an incline above 25 degrees.
Desertification has caused as much as US$7 billion (euro5.3 billion) in annual economic losses, the China Daily reported.
Farmers would suffer most as the natural environment deteriorated.
The ministry said it would help farmers working on hillsides at an incline above 25 degrees to build terraces, so the soil could be better contained, said E.
China is forcing nomadic Tibetan herders to settle in towns to clear land for development, leaving many unable to earn a living, a human rights group said in a report issued Sunday.
"If the government does nothing, it is scared that the entire area will become a desert," said Sun Qing-Wei, a desertification expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"Many Tibetan herders have been required to slaughter most of their livestock and move into newly built housing colonies in or near towns, abandoning their traditional way of life," the report said.
The resettlements began in 2000 and have taken place more intensively since 2003, Human Rights Watch said.
"But if we keep using the groundwater, it will decline," said Chen.
The government can show the people they are doing something."
"It's not that they are likely to face famine in the next few years.
It is not just Chen's home region that is at risk.
As a result, desertification is affecting 80 of Xinjiang's 90 counties and cities and nearly two thirds of its territory.
Erosion made the land less fertile or turned the soil into sand, and could affect agricultural production and lead to more frequent natural disasters such as drought.
1 Document has targeted agriculture and issues concerning the countryside, signaling again that the government's top priority is to help improve the lives of the country's 800 million farmers.
Hotter, drier land is more vulnerable to soil erosion, Wang said.
Global warming also threatens to make a huge dent in grain production, which Brown said has already slipped from 432 million tons in 1998 to 422 million tons in 2006 because of desertification.
"The region has a vulnerable ecology.
Expanding deserts have contributed to a nearly six-fold increase in sandstorms in the past 50 years to two dozen annually, Wang said.
About 450,000 local residents are facing a drastic deterioration of their living conditions, said officials from the department.
The production declines have forced China to draw down its grain stocks, and eventually it will need to buy a massive 30-50 million tons a year on the world market, Brown said.
The State Forestry Administration (SFA) has called together a team of 25 experts, including 10 members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to help improve storm forecasting and warning.
Farmers responded by digging thousands of wells, causing the water table to drop hundreds of feet and the soil to become contaminated with salt.
As the soil erodes, survival for local farmers becomes increasingly precarious.
In a problem that is pervasive in much of China, over-farming has drawn down the water table so low that desert is overtaking farmland.
Human Rights Watch said the resettlements in Tibet and in adjacent ethnic Tibetan areas of Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces are linked to Beijing's effort, launched in 1999, to develop China's poor, restive west and bind it to the bustling east.
"It will harm the country's economic and social development if we don't have effective measures to address the problem," said E.
It quoted one as saying: "Even if we become town dwellers and try to do business, we don't have the education or the experience to succeed.
Deserts have advanced an average three to four meters into the remaining land each year.
Last year, they advanced 6.19 meters, statistics from the local meteorological bureau showed.
Once part of a thriving village of 200 people in Gansu province, they are the only ones left after neighbors fled two years ago.
Chen was just a child when the government turned the rugged grasslands on the edge of the Tengger into an oasis.
Gone are the knee-high grasses and the Qingtu Lake, replaced by sands from the expanding Tengger and nearby Badain Jaran deserts and with soil scarred white from salt.
Authorities have ordered farmers here in Gansu province to vacate their properties over the next 3 1/2 years, and will replace 20 villages with newly planted grass in a final effort to halt the advance of the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.
Extremely strong winds derailed a passenger train in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on February 28, killing three people and injuring 30 others, two of them seriously.
At least 12 million people are suffering the consequences, ranging from drinking water shortages to cropland infertility.
This year's first sandstorm hit Minqin County of northwest China's Gansu Province on Friday, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said here on Saturday.
Experts said the pledge is expected to guarantee the basic livelihood of Chinese farmers who have lost their land to estate development or industry without proper compensation.
The county suffered only 14 sandstorms last year, compared with around 26 on average.
He pointed a finger to the excessive herding on the pastureland and farming along the Tarim River, China's largest inland river in the southern part of Xinjiang.
Eleven to 15 sand storms are expected hit China this spring, about the same as last year when the country experienced 14 sand storms but far less than the annual average of 26.
Despite a series of policies aimed at improving the income of farmers, including the abolishment agricultural tax, rural life remains hard, the document added.
China unveiled on Monday wide-ranging polices to improve sustainable agriculture and raise the incomes of hundreds of millions of farmers.
E said that 11 major state-level water and soil conservancy projects were currently in operation, covering 500-plus counties and cities.
Xinjiang has conducted three remote sensing surveys and set up a monitoring network to track its soil erosion.
It said tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands, of people have been affected.
By comparison, the United States has 20 percent of the world's arable land to feed 5 percent of the population.
Since 2001, China has spent billions of yuan planting trees, converting marginal farmland to forest and grasslands and fighting soil erosion.
But over the past two decades, new reservoirs were built farther up the Shiyang River, sapping the Hongyashan Reservoir.
"This is the same problem the United States faced in the 1930s with the dust bowl."
It would be better if my son lived with us.
But if he did, he wouldn't be able to find a wife."
We don't even know how to live from farming.
Desertification occurs when arable or habitable land is transformed into desert.
Their ancestors are buried on their land, and their crops continue to earn a tidy income, they say  even though the canals that once transported water to the area are bone-dry, and the wheat that thrived here is a distant memory.
But the initiative is also a tacit admission by the government that the effort to feed the country at all costs may have backfired.
Another official told Xinhua that the SFA is taking five specific measures to deal with sand storms, but he refused to say what the measures were.
"We have to think about the next generation."
"The government is taking this action against desertification, but we are the ones being forced to pay for this policy," said Li Jianzhu, a father of three in the village of Waixi, whose population has dropped nearly two-thirds to 60 residents.
The figure represents an increase of 11.5 percent from the amount lost from 2001 to 2005, he added.
Worried the desert could reach the city of Minqin, 35 miles (56 kilometers) away, authorities decided to return the land to its natural state.
At the same time, grain consumption has risen about 4.4 million tons a year to 418 million tons, in part because of rising demand for beef, chicken and pork.
China will encourage its farmers to use more environmentally-friendly fertilizers and pesticides to reduce pollution of the soil, rivers and lakes, according to the document, which is the year's first major policy paper jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
There has also been a more strict enforcement of laws and regulations designed to prevent trees from being cut or other practices that can cause erosion.
"There are alternative solutions like introducing new plant species or conserving water.
The SFA is also investing heavily in setting up a monitoring network, said an administration official.
Many communities have been emptied altogether, leaving behind crumbling homes and empty courtyards.
Overgrazing, deforestation, hillside farming, mining and road construction were frequently cited as examples of irrational economic activities.
Since 2001, China has spent nearly US$9 billion (euro6.8 billion) planting billions of trees, converting marginal farmland to forest and grasslands and enforcing logging and grazing bans.
In the 1950s, as part of Mao's scheme to boost food production, the government built the Hongyashan Reservoir in Gansu province with the goal of irrigating nearly 1 million acres (400,000 hectares).
Farmers also found it difficult to grow crops on slopes that were easily eroded.
"There are quite a few countries with this problem but none on the scale of China because it is so big," said Lester Brown, president of Earth Policy Institute.
The policy is driven in part by concerns over food, as farmland yields not only to the deserts but also to pollution and economic development.
The battle against deserts is playing out across much of western China.
So in future we will face great difficulty."
But he did not provide further details of any relocation plan.
"They are destroying our Tibetan (herder) communities by not letting us live in our area and thus wiping out our livelihood completely," one Tibetan, identified only by the initials F.R., was quoted as saying.
