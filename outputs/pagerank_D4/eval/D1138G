Since May, nearly 2,000 Kaiser patients awaiting transplants have been transferred to kidney programs at UC hospitals in San Francisco and Davis.
"There are organs out there that if we find the right recipient, they could be transplanted.
San Luis Obispo police and the Medical Board of California are looking into the conduct of Dr. Hootan Roozrokh, who was a surgeon at Kaiser's now-defunct kidney transplant program in San Francisco.
A report in a Japanese newspaper recently said that if the system of organ donation were regulated, the Philippines could see a rush of foreign patients, including from Japan, where 10,000 people are currently awaiting kidney transplants.
Doctors said Connor would not live long enough to await a heart that matched his Type A blood, but they had a heart from a Type B donor available.
But lawmakers want legal advice before acting on a bill that would shave up to 180 days off a prison sentence for inmates who donate.
State law specifies that transplant physicians or surgeons are not allowed to be involved in the treatment of potential organ donors before they are declared dead.
It is the first step in a new push by the United Network for Organ Sharing to decrease the number of children who die awaiting an organ transplant, a toll particularly high for infants and toddlers.
The Philippine government is to begin consulting on guidelines for human organ donations to foreigners, a government official said Tuesday.
Kaiser had been caring for about 1,500 patients who had already received transplants.
The takeover means that UC doctors now will care for Kaiser's kidney transplant patients before, during and after their surgeries.
In this case, however, Roozrokh entered the operating room at Sierra Vista and was directing the administration of drugs to Navarro and the removal of life support, the two sources said.
The courage of Charlene Strong, and the memory of Kate Fleming, should persuade legislators to enact domestic partnership legislation.
The state would also decide which inmates could donate.
Inmates in South Carolina could soon find that a kidney is worth 180 days.
South Carolina advocates for organ donations said the incentive policy would be the first of its kind in the nation.
China's military is reportedly harvesting organs from prison inmates, mostly Falungong practitioners, for large scale transplants including for foreign recipients, a study said Wednesday.
At a first-of-its-kind meeting March, UNOS will take a hard look at hurdles to improving child organ donation, especially for babies and toddlers.
1 People's Hospital and his convalescence at No.
More than 95,300 people in the U.S. are awaiting an organ transplant, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
For now, many transplant centers are like Webber's, trying their first mismatched transplants in babies before working up to toddlers.
But the new heart guidelines "have the potential for significantly impacting the number of patients who die on the waiting list."
The state Department of Managed Health Care continues to investigate Kaiser for the way it handled patient complaints, including those from kidney patients who said they were ignored.
"Local hospitals, which take in the majority of ill people, who need urgent treatment, can not remove organs," the law said.
Dozens more Chinese hospitals and jails were implicated in transcripts of new telephone calls, including one to an air force hospital in Chengdu City, in which an official said it would be "no problem" to get organs from young and healthy Falungong practitioners for a transplant.
When it became clear he would not live, his family agreed to allow his organs to be harvested, and transplant surgeons were summoned on Feb. 3, 2006.
"Recipients often tell us that even when they receive transplants at civilian hospitals, those conducting the operation are military personnel," the report states.
He suggested the law allow doctors to declare people brain dead so their organs can be used to save the lives of people suffering the prostration of an organ.
Even if it's one at a time, I'm willing to work on that."
"I think it's imperative that we go all out and see what we can do," said the bills' chief sponsor, Democratic Sen. Ralph Anderson.
``We have to guarantee to the public that we're not going to go out and kill people to get their organs,'' said Pruett, chief of transplant surgery at the University of Virginia.
Now the question is who is a good candidate for a mismatched heart, says Dr. Steve Webber, cardiology chief at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
The government is working on resuscitating the human organ donation program and, because of its international scrutiny, Zimbabwe will craft strong legislative laws to guard it from abuse, Muguti said.
About one in 5,000 children are born with a heart defect so bad that they'll need a transplant in the first year or two of life.
They also interviewed Canadian hospital staff who subsequently cared for hundreds of patients after they underwent dubious transplant surgeries in China.
In two hospital emergency rooms, each time with a loved one near death, I've been forced to face intense, unexpected decisions about life-support systems and donations of organs.
Dr. Phil Madvig, associate executive director of the Permanente group, said the closure of the transplant program and the subsequent transfer of patients are a ``very significant undertaking'' that the HMO is pleased to have nearly completed.
``This is the last piece of the puzzle,'' said Dr. Stephen Tomlanovich, medical director of UC San Francisco's renal transplant program.
"With a large number of organs in need, some people want to donate but often run into difficulties in the application process, " said Li, adding a specific law should be enacted to standardize the application and transplant process."
"After going through the most awful possible thing that I could have gone through in my life and almost dying myself, I was then denied access and the ability to tell them that they were allowed to take Kate's retinas," she testified.
The proposal approved by the Senate Corrections and Penology Subcommittee would set up a volunteer donor program in prisons to teach inmates about the need for donors.
Wang Xiaohua, a Falungong practitioner who now lives in Montreal, told reporters he "suffered inhumane persecution" at a Chinese labor camp where jailed Falungong practitioners, and not other prisoners, were systematically subjected to blood tests to match their organs with recipients.
Corrections Department Director Jon Ozmint said he believes inmates would donate even without the incentive.
In their previous report, Matas and Kilgour interviewed several Falungong members and the former wife of a surgeon who told her he had removed the corneas from some 2,000 anaesthetized Falungong prisoners in northeast China in the two years prior to October 2003.
"It will benefit many patients if the public can take the donation as a charity," said Chen.
Not being allowed to make those choices.
In 2005, the last count available, 45 children under age 2 died while awaiting a new heart.
Only the last "from an executed prisoner" was compatible, his military surgeon told him, according to the report.
He worried that they could scare people away from donating organs to help the 95,000 people awaiting life-saving transplants nationwide.
As of last month, 74 youngsters under 2 were on the waiting list.
UNOS' Sweet calls the heart policy "a first step in what we really think is a long process in improving wait-list mortality for all children."
Not getting to voice the loved one's wishes.
Nearly 120 Kaiser patients have received new kidneys, more than in the prior 20 months.
He said the government was looking at ways of regulating the process by which kidneys were obtained.
Some patients received transplants within weeks of transferring.
In June, the administrator of Kaiser's San Francisco hospital, Mike Alexander, stepped down.
In the nine months since the program announced its closure and began transferring patients, the pace of transplants has picked up considerably.
Inokuchi, who has been faulted by federal regulators for her role in Kaiser's troubles, will become a non-transplant nephrologist with Kaiser's affiliated Permanente medical group once the last patient is transferred and the program officially closes.
According to San Luis Obispo police, Navarro was on life support and near death after he was found unresponsive at Casa de Vida nursing home.
He was taken to Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo and placed on life support.
She was testifying for Senate Bill 5336, legislation that recognizes and grants rights to people in domestic partnerships, specifically same-sex couples and elderly couples who have not wed.
Sen. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, opted for a domestic partnership bill.
NPC deputy Li Bangliang, board chairman of East China Pharmaceutical Group Corporation, said a proper law is needed to guide the public how to donate their organs if they have such an intention.
"There are long-term inmates who would give if they knew a child was dying," he said.
Funding, which hindered the previous attempt to set up the program some 10 years ago, would also be sourced, he said.
Connor Geddes was 13 days old when surgeons gave him a new heart that did not match his blood type  deliberately.
And then, organ by organ, we discussed what was to be donated.
But Melissa Blevins, executive director of Donate Life South Carolina, said any incentive would break the law and the principle behind donations.
But babies' immune systems must learn to recognize and attack an organ of a different blood type, a process that is turning out to be more gradual than scientists long thought.
Eight kidneys were tested, to find a match.
They also urged countries to post travel advisories warning that organs from China may have been harvested from unwilling asked states to cease offering follow-up care to patients who had shady organ transplants in and called on foreign doctors to cut ties with their Chinese counterparts suspected of such practices.
"When I arrived at Harborview, I was denied access to Kathryn to be by her side as she lay dying.
A family member was called in Alexandria, Virginia, to allow me to be in that room with her.
Lawmakers are considering legislation that would let prisoners donate organs or bone marrow in exchange for time off their jail sentences.
"We want to make this work, we really do," said Republican Sen. John Hawkins.
Roozrokh did not return messages left at his work and cell phones.
If the policy sounds counterintuitive, well, it is: Implant a mismatched heart in an adult, and he or she will die rapidly.
"We have a huge need for organs and bone marrow," Cagle said.
It expands use of mismatched hearts up to age 2, as long as antibody tests show the toddlers are candidates.
Transplant a heart before the baby starts making antibodies that will attack a mismatched organ, and he or she survives as well as babies given matching hearts, says Dr. Lori West, the Canadian surgeon who pioneered incompatible transplants in Toronto in the late 1990s.
The concern: whether children really fare well years after getting a mismatched heart, or if rejection just sets in later.
As a loved one lay dying nearby, I had to answer 56 often- intimate questions about her life and health.
Now the U.S. transplant network is expanding that effort, saying youngsters may be candidates for an incompatible heart up to age 2.
About 1.5 million patients need organ transplant each year, but only 10,000 can find organs for transplant, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health.
At present there are no specific rules on organ donation to foreigners.
Starting this weekend, the government will begin a series of consultations with private and public health sector leaders on how to regulate organ donation in the "face of rampant, under-the-table traffic in human organs," Del Mundo said.
that we have accomplished this and put this behind us,'' Madvig said.
He died the following morning and, by that time, his organs were no longer viable for transplantation, police said in a statement.
Yukelson said outside transplant surgeons are not credentialed to operate on patients at the 165-bed hospital, and must wait until a patient isdeclared dead by hospital staff to begin organ procurement.
Kaiser had forced patients to leave established programs at two outside hospitals and join its own waiting list.
Police are investigating whether a Kaiser Permanente transplant surgeon attempted to hasten the death last February of a 25-year-old San Luis Obispo, Calif., man on life support in order to harvest his organs more quickly.
Sources identified the other doctor as Dr. Arturo Martinez, who at the time was the surgical director of Kaiser's transplant program, sources said.
Last month, the president of Kaiser's Northern California region, Mary Ann Thode, said she would retire by early 2008.
"We're in the three digits, up over 100 (from Canada each year) and the trend is accelerating," Matas said.
We must not let passages from the Old Testament, or the question of whether we "approve" of someone's lifestyle, distract us from our basic sense of decency and fair play.
Bishop Joseph Tyson, speaking for the Washington State Catholic Conference, spoke against SB 5336 at the hearing.
The 421 lawmakers of the Duma lower house of parliament voted unanimously in favour of the text, pointing to a lack of available organs as things stand.
She was the HMO's public face after the scandal broke and alternately apologized and defended the program's quality.
``That's the worst of those cheap sci-fi books: The ghoulish docs are out pulling the plugs on these poor defenseless people, trying to snatch their organs.''
As Hemenway testified, state Sen. Perry Woodall, R-Toppenish, read a newspaper on the dais in front of her, shuffling its pages as his colleagues strained to hear the woman's soft voice.
But there's a more important matter, the human consequences that flow from this nation's "values" debates.
"It will not happen overnight," cautioned Dr. Stuart Sweet of Washington University in St. Louis, chairman of UNOS' pediatric transplant committee.
Once before in my memory, 33 years ago, has Olympia heard such riveting testimony.
Connor, now 11 months old and thriving, is one of several dozen babies around the world to have received mismatched hearts, part of a slowly growing movement to increase these tiniest patients' survival by taking advantage of a lag in their immune systems.
The Catholic Conference ought to come back with a proposal to cover other relationships  after SB 5336 is passed and signed by Gov.
"It really muddies the water about motive.
In that instance, it was delivered by a friend of mine named Pat Hemenway, who was shot by a robber while walking with a friend in the Washington Park Arboretum, and rendered a quadriplegic.
One problem is that when grieving parents consent to a donation, organs aren't always recovered, perhaps because the local transplant center did not immediately see a good recipient, Sweet says.
There is opposition, from self-described defenders of "traditional values."
(Hemenway died of pneumonia soon after its enactment.)
Catholic social gospel even seeps through when The Stranger's gay editor, Dan Savage, excoriates the hierarchy in Rome.
The gay and lesbian community wants same-sex marriage.
He argued that those wanting to change the state's definition of marriage would "undermine the one source of social and civil stability available in many peoples' lives."
Strong was the partner of Kate Fleming, an audio-book narrator killed in her basement on that bleak day.
States should also enact legislation to ban their citizens from traveling to China for organ transplants from forced donors, although the study's authors admitted such prosecutions would be difficult to prove.
"After attempts by myself to retrieve Kate from her audio-book studio in our basement and almost drowning myself, I then followed the ambulance to Harborview Medical Center," Strong told senators.
China needs a law on organ transplant to regulate donation procedures, and encourage and facilitate people to become donors, lawmakers said on the sidelines of the annual full session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
Strong was then treated "like any other married person" by the hospital's medical staff.
Those babies still need immune-suppressing drugs for life  blood type is just one form of organ rejection.
Mary Jo Cagle, chief medical officer of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System in Greenville, South Carolina, urged senators to find an allowable incentive.
"But I want to make sure no one goes to jail for good intentions."
They know they're going to die in prison."
Canada's former Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas released a report Wednesday into such transplants after interviewing organ recipients in 30 countries.
Lawmakers want to know whether the term could apply to time off from prison sentences.
The allegations, if true, would constitute a grave breach of the nation's organ transplant rules, as well as a public relations setback for those promoting organ donation, experts in transplantation said.
UNOS began allowing them as a last resort for infants, under age 1, in only 19 were performed through 2005.
Yet few babies die of conditions that allow their hearts to be donated.
Experts believe that the concept of dead-brain declaration will greatly promote organ transplant.
But legislators postponed debate on a measure to reduce the sentences of participating prisoners, citing concern that federal law may not allow it.
"I would like to see us get enough donors that people are no longer dying."
Federal law makes it illegal to give organ donors "valuable consideration."
His heart's left side was too small to pump.
Babies begin producing antibodies to different blood types between 5 months and 2 1/2 years of age  it varies widely from child to child, says West, now at the University of Alberta's Stollery Children's Hospital.
They described one man traveling to Shanghai in 2003 for a kidney transplant at the civilian No.
Like many civilian hospitals in rural China, military hospitals turned to selling organs to make up for government funding cuts in the 1980s, the report states.
Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Edwin Muguti said strong regulatory measures would be put in place to ensure the success of the program and shield it from abuse.
It is the decent, humane thing to do.
"It doesn't mean there is no patient suitable for that organ in the whole United States," he says.
Subsequent organ donations now require the oversight of the hospital administrator on call.
``Let's just give him some more candy,'' Roozrokh told nurses in the operating room, according to a person who was briefed on what took place.
An emergency room is a place to say goodbye, profess one's love, but also to carry out the wishes of a person no longer able to speak for himself or herself.
As a result of the hospital's inquiry, an operating room nurse has been reassigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the investigation.
In this case, ``the transplant surgeon began to direct care in the operating room,'' Yukelson said.
The giant HMO announced in May that it was closing its fledgling kidney transplant program after the Los Angeles Times reported that hundreds of patients had been endangered during its start-up in late 2004.
The University of California, San Francisco has taken over a post-transplant clinic for kidney patients at Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco hospital, bringing to an end Kaiser's brief  and scandal-plagued  foray into the organ transplant business.
Tomlanovich's team will take over from Kaiser's transplant medical director, Dr. Sharon Inokuchi.
``This physician clearly violated our policy.''
The domestic partnership legislation is part of the "gay rights agenda" and "more about authenticating a lifestyle that is historically out-of-step with society and clearly in violation of biblical teaching," Gary Randall of the Faith and Freedom Network told his troops in an e-mail Friday.
"Be assured, the Domestic Partners bill that is now being heard is merely an incremental step toward gay marriage," Randall wrote.
As well, Tyson argued that the domestic partnership bill would extend rights only to a limited constituency.
An interesting sidelight to the partnership debate: Kate Fleming was a highly regarded parishioner at St. Therese Church.
China banned the spiritual group in 1999 and has vehemently denied the allegations of organ harvesting, accusing the Falungong of spreading rumors in a bid to undermine the country's international relations and "social stability."
Those allegations were vigorously denied by Chinese officials.
But military personnel could operate with much more secrecy, it added.
Kilgour and Matas admitted that many of the claims were second-hand, but said there was enough evidence to "paint a picture."
Under the proposals, money for medical procedures and any prison guard overtime would be paid by the organ recipient and charitable groups.
Russian lawmakers on Wednesday adopted on first reading a law which will allow local hospitals to remove and transplant organs, something only the big hospitals have been allowed to do.
To curb what they called a "disgusting form of evil," the pair publicly asked pharmaceutical firms to stop selling organ anti-rejection drugs to China.
The most awful ER experience, for me, was the litany of organ donation.
The US-based lobby group "The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falungong in China" had asked Kilgour and Matas to investigate claims by several of their members.
A state Senate panel on Thursday endorsed creating an organ-and-tissue donation program for inmates.
They said they listened, with the help of certified interpreters, to more than 30 veiled calls made from Canada and the United States to Chinese officials who admitted to the surgeries.
That happened in 2003, when surgeons in North Carolina accidentally gave a teenager the wrong-type heart and lungs.
Still, age is just a rough marker for antibody production, West stresses.
He said the program, which registered some meaningful success in the early 1990s, would help address some health issues and improve service delivery.
Currently, patients that require human organ donations have to go abroad as Zimbabwe does not have adequate and proper resources such as machines and funds to conduct the operations.
It is the second report to be released by the pair, who in July published the results of a two-month investigation in which they implicated dozens of hospitals and jails throughout China in the transplant scandal.
His tracheotomy tube  from lungs were weakened by heart-pumping machines while he awaited the transplant  is to be removed soon, and the scar on his chest is barely visible.
"Social customs are a big reason," said Chen, explaining that many Chinese are unwilling to donate organs because they consider the stop of breath and heartbeat the standard of death.
Last March, Connor Geddes became Pittsburgh's first of five such transplants.
We want to keep it a clearly altruistic act," she said.
It is strictly prohibited in China for illegal organ transplant, said Huang Jiefu, China's vice health minister.
The hospital also reviewed its policies and did extensive training, he said.
Blood tests to check antibodies are the real key.
Not being able to answer those questions.
But that voice had the power to persuade lawmakers to pass the Crime Victims Compensation Act.
Much of the trade in human organs, especially kidneys, takes place on the black market.
Eleven months later, Connor shows no sign of rejection and happily totters after his older brothers.
85 hospital of the People's Liberation Army.
The results of that inquiry are expected next month.
Health Undersecretary Jade Del Mundo said organ donation was big business in the Philippines, especially among the poor, who sell their kidneys.
United Network for Organ Sharing is the federal contractor charged with ensuring the safety and equity of the nation's transplant system.
Dr. Timothy Pruett, president-elect of United Network for Organ Sharing, called the allegations ``horrific.''
Actually, the Ministry of Health in 2006 drafted a set of regulations on human organ transplant to the State Council for revision and improvement.
Zimbabwe could soon revive its human organ donation program in a bid to keep up with global health technological developments, the official New Ziana reported on Saturday.
Still, until recently, U.S. transplant centers were reluctant to try mismatched hearts.
Merlin contended that Kaiser retaliated against him for raising concerns about the way the kidney program was operating.
Within days, nurses at the hospital  alarmed about what had taken place  alerted their superiors, Sierra Vista spokesman Ron Yukelson said.
At issue is whether Roozrokh ordered excessive doses of powerful pain medication to speed up the death of Ruben Navarro, according to several sources familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because investigations are ongoing.
Hence the new U.S. policy, adopted last fall and to go into effect later this year.
The two most outspoken gays to serve in the Legislature  Murray and the late state Sen. Cal Anderson  have been Catholics.
A Seattle woman name Charlene Strong faced exactly that situation during the Dec. 14 flood, and spoke to it recently in Olympia.
But, for a time, there was another obstacle.
Local hospitals, managed by regional authorities, are spread over the whole of Russian territory, but the most serious cases are, as things stand, then transferred to the central hospitals which are mainly in Moscow and in Russia's biggest cities.
Most organs were donated by ordinary citizens upon their death after the voluntary signing of donation agreements.
"When we talk to people, friends, and tell them, nobody really realizes that can happen."
In addition, Kaiser settled a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by former kidney transplant administrator David Merlin, who was fired in early 2006 after eight weeks on the job.
However, Chinese people's traditional view of "living till the last breath" has restrained living human organ supply, said NPC deputy Chen Haixiao, head of Taizhou Hospital in China's eastern Zhejiang Province.
"A family member was again contacted."
Two months later, Kaiser agreed to pay a $2-million fine to state HMO regulators and make a $3-million donation for organ donor outreach.
Neither surgeon was recovering the organs on behalf of rather, they were working on behalf of the local group that procures and distributes organs in the region.
It makes you hope to see a day when the church comes out from the shadow of discipline and dogma and into the sunlight of human rights  for all of God's children.
The Democratic-controlled Legislature is not prepared to go that far.
When Navarro did not die within 30 minutes  the time period set out to ensure the viability of the organs  he was returned to the intensive care unit, according to standard transplant procedures.
China is faced with a huge gap between the patients who need functional organs and limited donations.
But given the scarcity of tiny hearts, the mismatch option was good news.
"The involvement of the People's Liberation Army in these transplants is widespread," Kilgour told a press conference.
Only a few of the 90 or so mismatched heart transplants performed worldwide have occurred past a child's first birthday, the oldest in a 30-month-old in Britain.
Martinez could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
And in December, the national regulatory group overseeing transplantation stripped Kaiser of its good standing despite pleas from the HMO's representatives not to do so.
A study conducted recently by the University of the Philippines found that in one slum area in Manila, there were 3,000 men and women who had sold one of their kidneys for 70,000-120,000 pesos (1,440-2,469 dollars).
Organ trafficking has become a problem over the past few years in Russia and in 2005 four Russian doctors, who stood accused of trying to remove the kidneys of someone who was still alive, were acquitted.
"It still amazes me," says Carrie Geddes.
Hospitals in Canada's biggest cities, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto meanwhile confirmed "a substantial number" of Canadians had traveled to China for suspicious organ transplants, Kilgour said.
In the process, Kaiser lost track of many patients and delayed critical surgeries.
But the fallout from Kaiser's missteps continues.
This restriction is designed, in large part, to assuage concerns that the retrieval of organs could take priority over patient care.
An investigation immediately was launched, and regulators and the coroner were notified.
But in the last year  with some of West's initial patients now surviving a decade  that worry is fading.
Medical board spokeswoman Candis Cohen said her agency also is investigating the conduct of a second physician present during the incident.
