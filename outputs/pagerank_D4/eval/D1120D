More and more, he said, the cities will need that water.
Facing the worst drought in a century and the prospect that climate change could yield long-term changes on the Colorado River, the lifeline for several Western states, federal officials have reached a new pact with the states on how to allocate water if the river runs short.
Officials say a shortage will be declared when the water level at Lake Mead drops 36 feet below its current level, a change that is expected within the next few years.
As part of the seven-state agreement, Nevada will help pay for a reservoir in Southern California.
Preparing for worst-case outcomes, the seven states that draw water from the Colorado River  Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico in the upper basin and California, Arizona and Nevada in the lower basin  and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river, are considering plans that lay out what to do if the river cannot meet the demand for water  a prospect that some experts predict will occur in about five years.
Arizona water managers, who are first in line to have their water cut in a shortage under an agreement with other states, called for the plant to be turned on.
 Lake Powell, which holds water from the upper-basin states, and Lake Mead, which receives water from Powell, will be operated as one reservoir system.
``As the air gets warmer, there will be more water in the atmosphere.
About 90 percent of the delta's wetlands and natural habitat dried up over the past half century, as water from the Colorado was captured in reservoirs and diverted to farms and cities from Las Vegas to Mexicali, Mexico.
Ultimately, conservation will fall short, said Pat Mulroy, general manager of both the Las Vegas Valley Water District and of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
In return for financing the reservoir, Southern Nevada will get some of the captured water.
The pact includes a bundle of agreements with the states, including approval for water managers in the Las Vegas area, which gets 90 percent of its water from the Colorado, to get a greater share of Lake Mead water in exchange for financing a reservoir in California to capture large amounts of river water destined for Mexico but beyond that country's entitlement by treaty.
The seven Colorado basin states  Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California  would battle each other for diminished Colorado River flows.
Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
State and federal officials praised the agreement, which Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne was expected to sign Thursday, as a landmark akin to the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that first divvied up how much water the seven states served by the river  California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming  receive annually.
``We're not going to be able to carry on like we are,'' he said.
"They are looking at this in a way that will allow more development even though the water is not theoretically there."
"It's not clear that the states are saying, `OK, we're going to now live in this era of limits.'
Global warming will worsen drought and reduce flows on the Colorado River, a key water source for several western states, according to a report released Wednesday.
California, which has the biggest water allocation and seniority rights in the Lower Basin, would not be affected.
Officials from seven states recently forged a agreement about how to handle the current drought, which has left the Colorado River's big reservoirs  Lake Powell and Lake Mead  roughly half empty.
Nevada officials have said they will seek to block that plan if Utah stands in the way of theirs.
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will be able to store up to 1.5 million acre-feet in Mead, nearly double the capacity of its Diamond Valley Lake Reservoir in Riverside County.
Because California holds some of the most senior rights to the river, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico would experience cuts in deliveries before California, said Roger Patterson, assistant general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Scientists have concluded that the Colorado river system, which supplies water to 25 million people and several million acres of crop and ranch land, has been drier and more prone to severe drought than was the case in the early 20th century, when the river's flows were divvied among the seven basin states.
The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.
That group produced a plan to operate the desalter in a way that could still protect the Cienega de Santa Clara.
"Utah is being very disingenuous and we're calling them on it," said Patricia Mulroy, the chief executive of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the water agency responsible for finding water for Las Vegas and its suburbs.
Pat Mulroy, head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, had threatened to go to court to get more water.
But a series of unusually wet years made it more efficient to meet the treaty obligations with water from Lake Mead, so the plant sat idle.
The metropolitan area, which relies on the Colorado River for 90 percent of its water, is awaiting approval from Nevada's chief engineer.
This year, the spring runoff is expected to be about half its long-term average.
Later this year, Interior Secretary Dick Kempthorne is expected to announce the first-ever guidelines for managing reduced water deliveries from the Colorado in the event of shortages.
Without the water, the wetland would dry up.
One way water officials are trying to do that is through the Las Vegas Springs Preserve.
Where the atmosphere is configured to have high pressure and droughts, global warming will mean long, dry periods.
Among them is a proposed 280-mile pipeline that would direct water to Las Vegas from northern Nevada.
``Global warming will intensify drought,'' he says.
Global warming threatens water supplies in other ways.
"The plant was authorized to do one thing," Cherry said, "but we can study whether we could do other things."
The Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river system, predicts about a 5 percent chance of such a shortage being declared by 2010, but it all depends on how much the states are able to conserve and, of course, the weather.
Last year about 30 percent of the agency's water deliveries came from the Colorado, which provides about 10 percent of California's overall urban and agricultural supplies.
"Runoff in five of the seven Colorado River basin states is projected to decline by more than 15 percent during the 21st century," Kempthorne said.
Arizona considers the plant critical to the success of a seven-state Colorado River drought plan, a document that relies on augmenting the river's flow.
To meet the Mexican treaty terms without the desalter, the bureau had been drawing water from Lake Mead at the rate of about 100,000 acre-feet a year, more than 32 billion gallons.
The desalter's original purpose was to help the United States meet the terms of a water-quality treaty with Mexico, which protested the increasing levels of salt and other nutrients in the Colorado River by the time it reached the border.
For example, as Mexico dries out, there will be migration from rural areas to cities and then the U.S.,'' he said.
New scientific evidence suggests that periodic long, severe droughts have become the norm in the Colorado River basin, undermining calculations of how much water the river can be expected to provide for the region's future and intensifying pressures to find new solutions or sources.
"If there's enough will, you can make anything happen," he said.
"There is more water on paper than there actually is on the landscape," he said.
"But the truth is there's a lot of water there.
Las Vegas, the fastest growing major city in the country, and the driest, developed the pipeline plan several years ago to bring groundwater from the rural, northern reaches of the state.
"There are people in this valley who don't care how much water they use.
According to some long-term projections, the mountain snows that feed the Colorado River will melt faster and evaporate in greater amounts with rising global temperature, providing stress to the waterway even without drought.
Current casinos and hotels are also feeding most of the water they use back into the Las Vegas Wash, which feeds recycled water back to Lake Mead.
Now there are tense meetings among several states that rely on the Colorado.
For the U.S., the biggest problem in a future of chronic drought would be water shortages.
The river is a major source for Metropolitan, Southern California's major urban water supplier.
"Lake Mead is at 49 percent of capacity," says Scott Huntley, spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
An agreement reached a few years ago between farmers and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the chief supplier of water to that region, is one model.
The plan then had been to treat salty runoff from farms before it made its way into the Colorado River headed to Mexico, thus meeting the terms of an old water treaty.
Federal water managers say a shortage could be declared as early as 2010, allowing the Department of the Interior to reduce water deliveries to Arizona and Nevada, two of the seven states that have sparred over the waterway for decades.
A complex plan hammered out by the states along the Colorado River and expected to be signed by the secretary of interior next month will do that.
"If the only time people walk on that lawn they're pushing a mower, it's not functional," he said.
"Of course not," agreed Lopez, "but we're talking about water conservation."
"You sure as hell should pay more for water if you're moving to an area with limited water resources," said Rutledge, who's not on the panel.
The Santa Clara offered on-the-ground proof that a little water could help revive the delta.
Strong, director of Utah's Division of Water Resources, said Nevada was protesting too much and instead should be cheering the Lake Powell project because Colorado River water that Utah does not use would flow in Nevada's direction.
Then in 1935, the Hoover Dam opened on the Colorado River, creating what is now Lake Mead.
Southern Nevada must find new ways to bring in water, she said.
"It's hugely important for us," said Scott Huntley, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
And in Las Vegas, as in Atlanta, the rain has stopped falling.
The study, which was sponsored by the National Academies, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies, notes that temperatures have risen in the western United States over the past century and are expected to keep climbing.
The shortage guidelines, more than two years in the making, come in the eighth year of the worst drought in the century-long historic record of the Colorado, which supplies water to 25 million people and 1 million acres of farmland.
Scientists also predict that climate change will worsen Western drought patterns and reduce Colorado flows by increasing evaporation and decreasing snowfall.
If it's not repaired next time he checks, a fine will be added to the water bill for this address.
``I think a reasonably savvy person would have to say you're going to see less water in that river,'' said Brad Udall, director of Western Water Assessment at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who was not a member of the report committee.
Now imagine what pumping for a whole big city is going to do."
``It's going to enhance the droughts'' that are part of the natural climate cycle.
But the original spring dried up 45 years ago, and now Lake Mead is in serious trouble.
Inevitably, water be would reallocated from agriculture, which uses most of the West's supplies, to urban users, drying up farms.
Anything to keep water in Lake Mead could forestall a shortage.
"These are exciting times here," said Cherry, Yuma area manager for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the desalter.
This is an example of where at the grass-roots level, these agencies and the other groups got together and said, 'Let's see what we can do.'
In a separate plan, the Southern Nevada Water Authority proposes purchasing and pumping billions of gallons of groundwater from rural east-central Nevada for use by Las Vegas, an idea that's sparked much controversy.
Those are the people who should have to pay."
But he said the institute's plan " works against agricultural interest, conservative interest and the interests of large communities" vying for the water .
Under an agreement with environmentalists, the federal Bureau of Reclamation plans to closely monitor the environmental effects of using the plant, and study, among other things, using the purified water for purposes other than meeting its treaty obligations, like supplying the growing cities around Yuma.
That is enough water to meet annual needs for about 3 million average households.
Although California's seniority rights put it in the best position of the Lower Basin states, the agreement benefited the state by preventing "bloody legal fights in Congress or the courts," said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
The ongoing drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade ago were under water.
The agreement, the product of two-and-a-half years of negotiation and study, establishes criteria for the Interior Department to declare a shortage on the river, which would occur when the system is unable to produce the 7.5 million acre-feet of water, enough to supply 15 million homes for a year, that the three down river states are entitled to.
It puts in place new measures to encourage conservation and manage the two primary reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which have gone from nearly full to just about half empty since 1999.
That is expected to make it easier to control Mead's level and the shortage triggers.
"The Colorado River is absolutely a finite resource, and we have to be careful in how we manage it," said Jennifer Pitt, a senior resource analyst for the advocacy group Environmental Defense who was part of that first campfire conversation.
In Yuma, on the Arizona border with Mexico, officials have pinned hopes on a desalination plant built 15 years ago.
Its reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are drying, leaving accusatory rings on the shorelines and imperiling river-rafting companies.
Their plans formed the basis of the document signed by Kempthorne, who called it "an agreement to share adversity" and a landmark in the tangled history of Colorado River management.
When drought struck the river in the early years of this decade, lowering reservoir storage by half, state officials brought up the idea of restarting the desalination plant.
"We have had good news and bad news," said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne in a speech before signing the shortage document at the Colorado River Water Users Association meeting at Caesars Palace.
For the first time, state water authorities shut off irrigation pumps to large parts of the valley, forcing farmers to dig wells.
"I don't think we want golf courses to go out of business," Winkle replied.
``Eventually, the water will be so deep the farmers won't be able to afford to pump it,'' he said.
But this time people in the driest states are not just scanning the skies and hoping for meteorological rescue.
``Sure, my tomatoes can be grown in other parts of the world,'' he said.
A few miles south of Fresno, Steve Arthur is looking the other way for water.
There can be benefits for everybody."
``Now that is not a happy picture,'' Smerdon said.
Even now, nature tourism is a going concern.
Officially, the test will help determine whether the desalter still works, how much operating it full time would cost and how it would affect the wetland known as the Cienega de Santa Clara, a critical habitat for migratory birds.
Visitors from the U.S. and Mexico are drawn to the Cienega de Santa Clara and other destinations by the estimated 350,000 birds that still nest and feed in the delta.
It happened naturally, not because some manager decided to release water."
The potential for conflict is more than theoretical.
The accord is expected to forestall litigation that was likely to have arisen as fast-growing states jockey for the best way to keep the water flowing to their residents and businesses in increasingly dry times.
True, the lake's water level was this low 45 years ago, though Huntley attributes much of that to the filling of Lake Powell, 490 miles upriver in Utah.
But that supply is also finite, the authors emphasized, and shifting water from farm to city could have negative impacts.
But as the mercury rises, water demands would increase.
But all customers would be affected.
Denver gets most of the water and has most of the state's population.
Now the head of the water authority here attributes the drought's length and severity to climate change.
Without some very wet years, Lake Mead might never refill, according to federal hydrologists.
Neither the 1944 treaty that allocates Colorado River water to Mexico nor any environmental law in that country mandates water for the delta.
From the day the plant stopped running in 1992, water continued to flow over the border down the delivery channels, which meant, on paper, Mexico was receiving more than its share of river water.
Mexico, which has a share of the river under a 1944 treaty and has complained of U.S. diversions in the past, would join the conflict.
But with water levels in reservoirs dropping, a record eight-year drought, the prospect that climate change could bring more dry spells and new scientific analyses suggesting the West could be drier than has been traditionally believed, the states were pushed to act.
The reductions will total less than 10 percent of the Lower Basin's allocation.
People have been working here 15 years or more, and we've never really operated the plant."
Under the institute's plan, the delta would get about three-tenths of a percent of the river's historic annual flow, making it one of the more modest claims on a river that serves 30 million people.
Nevada, which has the smallest water allotment in the Lower Basin, plans to hold water in Mead from fallow farmland along the Virgin and Muddy rivers.
In only one year of the last seven  2005  has the runoff been above average.
The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.
The new accord, outlined by federal officials in a telephone news conference Friday, spells out how three down-river states, California, Arizona and Nevada, will share the pain of river shortages.
The group proposed a series of ideas, most based on finding other water sources to meet the treaty terms and still support the wetlands.
The U.S. Department of Interior, which oversees the Colorado's management, is reviewing a drought plan the states put together last year.
The lake's water level has risen and fallen, but never has the drop been quite like this.
His company is working around the clock, drilling wells to irrigate fields in California's 400-mile-long Central Valley, one of the most productive food-growing areas in the world.
"None of the municipal agencies are saying, `We need to re-evaluate our urban plans, our growth plans because there's only so much water,' " he said.
Cherry said the researchers used the time well.
For 30 years, the crown jewel of the delta's remaining wetlands, the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara in Sonora, Mexico, has relied entirely on brackish discharges from a nearby irrigation district.
Now the operative word is "conserve."
Ranchers and farmers in northern Nevada and Utah are opposed to the pipeline plan and have vowed to fight it in court, saying it smacks of the famous water grab by Los Angeles nearly a century ago that caused severe environmental damage in the Owens Valley in California.
Las Vegas' exploding population and growing water needs have been a driving force behind the state talks.
But the lake was lapping at the top of Hoover Dam just two decades ago.
They also tried desalting local groundwater to see if the plant could produce drinking water someday for small communities on either side of the border.
Such measures as conservation, desalination and water recycling would be helpful, the authors said, but wouldn't offer a panacea.
The melting snow on the western slopes of the Rockies feeds into the Colorado River to flow west and south, across parts of Colorado, Utah and Arizona, and, since the construction of the dam, into Lake Mead, some 30 miles east of Las Vegas.
"Scientists say that global warming will eliminate 25 percent of our snowpack by the half of this century," Schwarzenegger said recently in Fresno, Calif., "which will mean less snow stored in the mountains, which will mean more flooding in the winter and less drinking water in the summer."
But the atmosphere's temperature is rising fastest at high altitudes.
Both are among the country's fastest-growing cities.
As global warming heats the planet, people will take more desperate measures.
They thought a wet 2006 ended a seven-year drought, but this year is one of the driest on record.
``We can increase the rainfall by 10 percent.
The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth, political pressure and the hard truth that the Colorado River, a 1,400-mile-long silver thread of snowmelt and a lifeline for more than 20 million people in seven states, is providing much less water than it had.
Despite the strides the authority has made, critics say Las Vegas should do more to conserve water.
Farther south and east, the once-mighty Colorado River is looking sickly, siphoned by seven states before dribbling into Mexico.
One study released earlier in 2007 warned that global warming could thrust the Southwest into a state of permanent drought by 2050.
But most days, he and the 10 other Las Vegas water cops average about 14 apiece.
Doug Bennett, who moved to Vegas from New Mexico about the time the drought started in 2000, is the water authority's manager of conservation.
We've seen time and time again that the law of the river can be flexible enough to meet the needs of water users in the basin.
Colorado recently hired a mediator to try to settle a long-running dispute over how water from the Rocky Mountains should be shared among users in the Denver area and the western half of the state.
They increased the plant's efficiency from a 73 percent recovery rate, when 10 gallons of raw water produced slightly more than seven gallons of treated water, to about 85 percent.
It's the one thing - stretching the over-allocated Colorado River - that stuck in the minds of Arizona water managers.
What unites the Western states is a growing consensus among scientists that future climate change and warmer temperatures, if they continue, could hit harder here than elsewhere in the continental United States.
Not quite three years ago, on a beach in the bottom of the Grand Canyon, a water manager and an environmentalist struck up a conversation.
The other sources could include groundwater or runoff from other farm fields.
It also will bring together the West's water buffaloes - the use-it-up gang - and the increasingly influential conservation movement for a grand experiment in the management and the politics of water.
Against that backdrop, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California began negotiations in 2005 to write a blueprint for water shortages.
The plan is supposed to ensure that Lake Mead doesn't fall below a minimum level.
The river's annual flow has fallen as low as 25 percent of normal since 2000, and some scientists have predicted that with the growing influence of climate change, flows will average 50 percent to 60 percent of normal over the next 50 years.
In the spring of 2004, Bennett Raley, then a deputy Interior secretary, took a group of water managers, environmentalists and journalists on a rafting trip on the Colorado, hoping to spark conversations about the river's future.
Which brings us to the campfire along the Colorado River in the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

All that water flowing past the desalter into Sonora didn't just vanish into the desert.
Ten percent of zero is zero,'' says Johnson, a meteorologist and director of Atmospherics Inc.
In its forthcoming analysis of the delta, the nonprofit Arizona institute paints a dire picture of the once-vibrant ecosystem.
Environmentalists attacked the desalter as a waste of money, a white elephant that would trample a delicate slice of desert life.

Although outdoor watering is still permitted on a strict schedule, spilling water into the street is not.
The oldest, first-filed claims, many dating to pioneer days, get water first, with newer claims at the bottom of the pecking order.
"The Western mountain states are by far more vulnerable to the kinds of change we've been talking about compared to the rest of the country, with the New England states coming in a relatively distant second," said Dr. Michael Dettinger, a research hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey who studies the relationships between water and climate.

And, of course, they drive the area's economy.
"It's a balancing act that's not achievable," he said.
It's the last stand for wetlands on the Mexican side."
The guidelines, which will be in effect for the next 19 years, contain three major elements:
For environmental groups, the plant embodied a destructive "use-it-up" attitude about water and a direct threat to a thriving wetland 90 miles south in Sonora.
``This is a situation that is going to cause water wars,'' said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
Inside of a decade, the marshy area grew from a few hundred acres, derisively called the Santa Clara Slough, to the 40,000-acre Cienega de Santa Clara, a wetland that harbors some of the rarest species in the hemisphere.
Conservationists say the Santa Clara's continued health will boost efforts to restore wider swaths of the river delta.
And true, the water level fluctuates naturally.
``You are going to intensify the hydrologic cycle.
``There's only so much water to go around.''
The Rates Citizen's Advisory Committee, a 14-member panel, was appointed by the Las Vegas Valley Water District to recommend a water pricing structure that would strengthen conservation.
But the Sonoran Institute contends that there is still nearly enough unclaimed water in the river to revive the delta without impinging on any existing rights on either side of the border.
It's entitlement is not impacted," said Bill Swan, water rights attorney for the Imperial Irrigation District, which gets three-fourths of California's Colorado allotment.
But federal officials said they took the best of several proposals by the states, environmental organizations and others and emphasized the importance of all seven states agreeing with the result.
"The history of the city is the history of the water in this valley," said Marcel Parent, the preserve's education director.
"There are significant human benefits to the proposal," said Mark Lellouch, one of its authors.
Without some very wet years, federal water managers say Lake Mead may never completely refill.
For many activists the wetland also helped support arguments for restoring water to the larger Colorado River Delta, a 1.9 million acre expanse from the U.S.-Mexican border to the Gulf of California, the river's historic endpoint.
Both water managers and environmental groups see a broader picture in this debate.
Meanwhile, Utah has proposed a $500 million, 120-mile pipeline from Lake Powell to serve the fast-growing City of St. George and Washington County in the state's southwestern corner.
The group also proposed expanding the mission of the plant so it could offer the desalted water to communities in short supply.
Higher temperatures would mean more rain falling rather than snow, compounding issues of water storage and potentially affecting flooding.
These factors "forced the issue to the head and we decided to do something unique and different," Guenther said.
Global warming will only make matters worse, said Connie Woodhouse, a University of Arizona associate professor of geography who helped write the report.
 Outside the Bellagio casino, tourists stare at fountains thrusting water into the sky as Elvis sings "Viva Las Vegas."
The Southern Nevada Water Authority also will build a small reservoir, called Drop Two, near the Mexican border to capture flows ordered by U.S. farmers who don't use it during rain.
One way of discouraging water use could be to make it more expensive.
But water users in the mountains, notably the ski resort industry, also have clout and want to keep their share.
"It's the most biologically significant wetland in the Sonoran Desert," said Karl Flessa, a University of Arizona geosciences professor.
It allows the Southern Nevada Water Authority to pipe water from the Muddy, a short river about 60 miles northeast of Las the Virgin, a long tributary of the and the Coyote Spring Basin northeast of the city.
Water agencies then could pay irrigation districts to let farmland lie fallow, keep the unused irrigation water stored in Mead and draw on it at a later date.
The great dams and reservoirs that were envisioned beginning in the 1800s were conceived with farmers in mind, and farmers still take about 90 percent of the Colorado River's flow.
That measure would decrease flows to the Colorado's ecologically important delta, potentially sparking outcry from Mexico.
``Increasing demands are impeding the region's ability to cope with droughts and water shortages.''
Late last year, in support of efforts by California to reclaim water that has been seeping across the border and nourishing crops and wetlands in the delta, Congress passed legislation barring the use of U.S. environmental laws to protect Mexico's interests.
Federal scientists say that if they remain below average or even average, Lake Mead might never completely refill.
But he wasn't prepared to say the states that rely on the Colorado River have fully acknowledged a drier future.
The idea here is we better hang on to what we've got.
A proposed reservoir just north of the California-Mexico border would correct an inefficient water delivery system that allows excess water to pass to Mexico.
Dettinger said warmer temperatures have pushed the spring snowmelt and runoff to about 10 days earlier on average than in the past.
For Arizona water managers, the $280 million desalter represented a way to stretch the Colorado River a little further, hedging against drought and growing demand.
He found remarkable consistency: Sometime before 2050, the models predicted, the Southwest will be gripped in a dry spell akin to the Dust Bowl drought, which lasted through most of the 1930s.
The climate will be wetter in some places, drier in others.
 They set particular water-level elevations of Lake Mead as triggers for water cutbacks.
That whiteness covering the desert hillsides is a sort of bathtub ring, measuring through calcium and other mineral deposits how much the water level has dropped in Lake Mead over the years, especially within the last decade.
"Southern Nevada thinks it can come up here and suck all these springs dry without any problems," said Dean Baker, whose family's ranch straddles the Nevada-Utah border, pointing out springs that farmers have run dry with their own wells.
The report, which examined climate modeling and tree ring data, reaffirms a more pessimistic assessment of river hydrology that has emerged in recent years.

The agriculture wastewater intended for desalination feeds the wetland, providing habitat for birds and fish, and supports a small local economy.
In dry and hot seasons, the edges slowly melt, gently feeding streams and rivers.
But where, and when, it comes down is the big uncertainty.
Most of the state's river allotment  the biggest in the system  goes to the Imperial Irrigation District, which distributes water to the croplands of the Imperial Valley, one of the nation's biggest lettuce producers.
That is when the birds flew into the picture.
The probability projection "does not imply it can't happen," said Terry Fulp, a bureau official involved in managing the river.
"I'd invested a lot of energy in simply trying to tell the world what a problem the plant would be," Pitt said.
Some environmental groups said the pact did not go far enough to encourage conservation and discourage growth.
But it also puts forth a proposal for replenishing much of the area by replacing a fraction of the river water that once flowed through the delta, saying it would be enough to restore much of the area's natural wealth.
"The governor had letters from the environmental organizations opposing it.
But John Weisheit, conservation director for Living Rivers, a Utah-based environmental group, said the agreement sends the message to the states that growth trumps sensible water management.
But, ``mechanistically, this is different.
Eight years of drought in the Colorado watershed have raised the likelihood of shortages in the near future, and as officials in the U.S. and Mexico look for creative ways of limiting future cutbacks, every drop will count.
Las Vegas takes conservation seriously enough to give its water agency its own police force.
Powers reported from Las Vegas and Boxall from Los Angeles.
``What we want people to do is to be aware of these scientific facts and take them into account as they plan for development, for drought-contingency plans.''
It turns out that period was unusually wet, prompting an overly generous estimate of how much water would be available to farms and cities.
"St. George, Utah, is growing as fast as southern Nevada, because the growth is going right up the I-15 corridor."
The city offered inducements to cut consumption, negotiated agreements with other regions and proposed a controversial pipeline that resulted in a tug of war with a neighboring state.
But she said she would cherish one experience - watching the Bellagio's fountain shooting water to the heavens as Elvis sang.
``All of the models are predicting very significant warming in the future,'' said Smerdon, a former engineering college dean at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
Up and running, the desalter could convert billions of gallons of agriculture wastewater each year into a usable resource, preserving long-term storage in Lake Mead and protecting Arizona from shortages.
In the meantime, we'd all be sucking air."
The people pouring into Vegas must be educated about the concept of desert life, said Bronson Mack, a spokesman for the water authority.
"It never made sense to me to just dump bottled-water quality water into the river anyway," said Jim Cherry, the bureau's Yuma area manager.
Noting that farms remain the dominant water user in the Colorado basin, the report called agricultural water ``the most important and perhaps final large reservoir of available water for urban use in the arid U.S.
A series of wet years rendered it unnecessary.
Standing on the main floor of the Yuma Desalination Plant, surrounded by long rows of fiberglass membranes stacked more than 7 feet high, Jim Cherry can't help but smile.
Nevadans have cut five billion gallons a year just on the turf they've dug up since 2003, when the Southern Nevada Water Authority started paying people $1 a square foot to get rid of their grass so they wouldn't have to water it.
"One of the reasons the delta is so interesting is that simply adding water will get you a quick response," said Michael Cohen, a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group.
Nevada shares the Colorado River with six other Georgia competes with Alabama and Florida for the Chattahoochee.
The bureau decided to divert water drained from farm fields in the nearby Wellton-Mohawk Valley, remove the salt and send it down the river.
To ensure timely flows, the institute has proposed amending the 1944 treaty to allow Mexico to bank water in the U.S. and participate in a bi-national water market.
Under the terms of the agreement, farmers would fallow their fields and send water to urban areas in exchange for money to cover the crop losses.
The plan faces its first test in early March, when the federal government restarts the plant for a 90-day, low-power test run.
"It's going to get uglier before it gets better," Mulroy predicted.
Seager predicts that drought will prompt dislocations similar to those of the Dust Bowl.
"If we fail right now, we might really fail, as the shortage becomes a reality and discussions about saving water for conservation become a lot harder," said Jennifer Pitt, a policy analyst with the group Environmental Defense, which works closely with the Sonoran Institute.
They're set by the regional water authority, formed in 1991 to bring together seven separate water jurisdictions.
In Yuma, Ariz., federal officials have even restarted an idled desalination plant, long seen as a white elephant from a bygone era, partly in the hope of purifying salty underground water for neighboring towns.
Some environmentalists say parts of the state could become a dust bowl.
The agreement avoided a prolonged legal battle among the seven states by tinkering with river law without changing the fundamentals of the 1922 compact that divided the Colorado's flow among them.
For Wilson, the issue was basic: In the event of a shortage on the Colorado, the CAP canal, which delivers river water to Phoenix and Tucson, takes the first and biggest hit.
Among the rafters were Pitt, the Environmental Defense analyst who wanted the desalter kept silent, and Sid Wilson, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, who was leading the charge to restart the plant.
Changing weather patterns will leave millions of people without dependable supplies of water for drinking, irrigation and power, a growing stack of studies conclude.
After floods washed away one of the diversion canals in 1992, the bureau mothballed the plant, just nine months after turning it on.
Researcher Seager suggests that humans ought to bend more to nature than trying to bend nature.
The river rarely reaches the delta anymore, its flow sucked dry by dams, canals and other diversion points along its final miles.
But he chafes at Seager's suggestion.
The United States and southern Europe will be far better prepared than the poor nations of Africa to deal with more frequent drought.
According to the IPCC, that means a drying out of areas such as southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, South Australia, Patagonia and the U.S. Southwest.
"I definitely see that as the future," Johnson said.
Pitt and Wilson continued talking after the trip, and inside of a few months, they hatched an idea to organize a working study group.

Meanwhile, off the Strip, residents dig up their lawns to save water - and get paid for it.
Conservation groups rallied against restarting the desalter because, as designed, it would take most of the water feeding the wetland and return only the sludge left from the desalination process.
Some rural Nevadans resent the expanding city.
Some members of the advisory board - which includes representatives of gaming and development, labor unions and golf courses - are concerned that prices may escalate too quickly and businesses might be disproportionately affected.

Upriver at Lake Powell, which is at its lowest level since spring 1973, receding waters have exposed miles of mud in the fingered side canyons leading to the Glen Canyon Dam.
Weisheit said the conservation should have been stressed and the government's computer modeling was overly optimistic about future water supply.
Mulroy said the agreement, reached after "four years of chest beating" and "some very childish behavior" among the states, is much more equitable.
Michael Cohen, senior associate for the Pacific Institute, called the agreement a large step forward.
Some colorful flowering plants and shrubs demand much less water than grass.
But even that amount could be a hard sell.
There would be more evaporation from croplands and reservoirs, and wild land vegetation would suck more moisture from the soil, reducing runoff.
