One of Michael Vick's co-defendants pleaded guilty Monday to federal dogfighting conspiracy charges in a plea agreement with prosecutors.
The plea hearing could mean that Taylor, who pleaded not guilty to the charges Thursday, has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
Tony Taylor, who along with Vick pleaded not guilty to the charges just four days ago, has promised to cooperate with federal prosecutors and share "detailed facts" for their case against Vick and two other co-defendants, Purnell Peace and Quanis Phillips.

The indictment says Vick and the others set up a business called "Bad Newz Kennels" to raise and train pit bulls for fighting.
See, the feds are charging Vick with holding pit bull dog fights on his property in rural Virginia.

Since being indicted on charges of sponsoring, gambling on and authorizing acts of cruelty against dogs, Vick has had his football career put on hold  and in jeopardy.
Taylor confirmed in the statement of facts he signed with federal prosecutors that he used a large portion of his gambling winnings from the dogfights for living expenses because he devoted his time to caring for and training the pit bulls.
Tony Taylor, among four men charged with organizing and staging dogfights across US state border lines, has changed his plea to guilty, ESPN and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, and Quanis L. Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, pleaded not guilty last week in the case.
Because a trial in the case has been scheduled for Nov. 26, the judge and prosecutors will have time to evaluate the extent of Taylor's cooperation before setting a punishment.
A federal grand jury indicted Taylor, Vick and the two others this month on a single count of conspiring to violate three laws: the interstate travel act by crossing state lines to engage in illegal sponsoring a dog in an animal fighting and buying, transporting and receiving dogs for animal fighting.
The document says the dogfight plan began in 2001, with property for housing and training dogs bought weeks after Vick was the first player selected in the NFL Draft.

A spokesman for Vick also declined to comment.
According to the 18-page indictment, the dogfighting ring executed underperforming dogs by drowning, hanging and other brutal means.
Taylor has had other run-ins with the law.
Taylor also signed a 13-page statement of facts outlining the charges against him, Vick and the two others, stating they are "true and accurate" and that had Taylor's case gone to trial prosecutors could have proven "these facts beyond a reasonable doubt."

In June of 2002, Taylor signed the articles of incorporation as the organizer for a business based at that Surry County property called MV7 LLC.
At Taylor and Vick's arraignment Thursday, federal prosecutors announced they would seek a "superceding" indictment in the case before the end of August, which could mean additional charges and defendants.
The indictment alleges the fights offered purses as high as $26,000, and Vick once paid $23,000 to the owner of two pit bulls that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.

The 18-page indictment against the men accuses them in graphic detail of animal cruelty.
The charges on Vick say dogs who were too scared to fight were tortured, shot, drowned, hanged or electrocuted.
After they investigated the property, authorities said they found kennels, treadmills, a "rape stand" used to restrain aggressive female dogs during breeding, and 54 pit bulls, some with scars and injuries officials said are consistent with dog fighting.
Also last week, Nike suspended Vick's endorsement contract without pay and Reebok halted sales of jerseys bearing his name.
