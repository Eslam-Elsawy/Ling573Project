They were the second group of fishermen from China's Hainan island jailed this week for turtle poaching off the waters of Malaysia's eastern Sabah state, with 17 men sentenced on Wednesday for catching 274 of the creatures.
The poachers were caught by Malaysian marine police on March 28 in waters off the coast of eastern Sabah state with a catch of 274 protected Hawksbill and Green turtles, only 32 of which were still alive.
Mohamad Yusoff Anthony, from Sabah's fisheries department, said the Chinese fishermen on Wednesday received sentences of six months for each of three offences of poaching the two turtle species, and encroaching on Malaysian waters.
Mohamad Yusoff Anthony, the prosecutor in the case for Sabah's fisheries department, said a magistrate's court had jailed the 13 for the three offences of poaching two protected turtle species, and encroaching on Malaysian waters.
He said Malaysian marine police seized the turtles from the Hainan fishermen's trawler late last month after they were caught in the waters off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.
The same court also jailed nine Vietnamese fishermen for six months each for illegally fishing off the eastern state of Sabah, prosecuting officer Mohammad Yusoff Anthony of the Sabah state fisheries department told The Associated Press.
A Malaysian court jailed 17 Chinese fishermen from southern Hainan province for 18 months each for poaching hundreds of protected turtles, officials said Thursday.
A Malaysian court Friday jailed a group of 13 Chinese fishermen for 18 months each for poaching nearly 80 protected turtles, officials said.
A court in eastern Malaysia has jailed 17 Chinese fishermen for 1 1/2 years each after they failed to pay fines for poaching almost 300 protected turtles in Malaysian waters, an official said Thursday.
The boat is from China, they are of Chinese nationality," he said.
Marine police on Wednesday stopped a fishing boat from China's Hainan province near the coast of Malaysia's eastern Sabah state and found more than 200 protected green and hawksbill turtle species on board, The Star and the New Straits Times reported.
Mohamad Sueb said the fisheries department would be prosecuting the Chinese for encroaching in Malaysia's waters and poaching.
Mohammad Yusoff said the Chinese fishermen were fined a total of 1.88 million ringgit euro406,000) after they admitted to the three offenses of encroaching into Malaysian waters and catching two types of protected species  the green and the hawksbill turtles.
Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.
Sabah marine police chief Mohamad Sueb Abdullah said marine police boarded the boat after sighting it in waters off the coast on Wednesday morning.
Instead of paying the fines, all of them went to jail for 18 months  six months for each offense, he said, confirming reports of the case in the New Straits Times and The Star.
There are seven sea turtle species in the world.
Turtles are poached for their shells to be made into decorative items, and for their meat, which is believed in many Asian cultures to have medicinal value.
"Of the 185 Green turtles and the 89 Hawksbill turtles, 32 are still alive and we are going to release them very soon," said Mohamad Yusoff.
The arrests follow a similar incident Monday off Sabah's waters, where marine police detained 19 Chinese nationals from Hainan with 78 turtles, most of them dead as well.
Turtles are poached for their shell, for decorative items and meat, which is believed in many Asian cultures to have medicinal value.
On March 26 they caught 19 Chinese nationals, also from Hainan, with nearly 80 turtles, most of which were also dead.
Malaysian authorities seized a second Chinese trawler allegedly poaching endangered turtles and other marine animals from waters off its coast this week, newspapers reported Thursday.
The arrest of the 17 Chinese fishermen was the second swoop by marine police last month.
The case of another Chinese trawler found also late last month with 70 mostly dead turtles on board will be heard Friday, Yusoff said.
Some species are killed for meat, others for their shells.
"We believe they are of the same group ... according to them they are from the same place, Hainan," he said.
The 13 Chinese were part of an original group of 19 captured by marine police on March 26 with 47 Green turtles and 29 Hawksbill turtles.
The fishermen did not pay and so went to jail for six months each.
The ones that remained were still on antibiotics and will be returned to South Padre waters in the summer, he said.
"The fisheries department is taking action, they are going to prosecute this case," he said.
Only about 20 of the turtles were still alive, the newspapers said.
Only about 20 turtles were still alive.
"They are from the same area, I think also from the same syndicate," said Mohamad Yusoff of the two groups.
"Not only have they encroached into our waters, they were catching internationally protected turtles."
He said the captain of the Chinese-registered boat was fined 508,000 ringgit (147,182 dollars) and each of the crew 86,000 ringgit in lieu of jail terms, but they opted to serve consecutive jail terms instead of paying.
Penalties for the offences are a one million ringgit (289,813 dollar) fine for the skipper and a 100,000 fine for each of the crew, or up to five years in jail for failure to pay, according to police.
The zoo is the only facility in the world successfully breeding the Arakan forest turtle, a species native to Myanmar that is on the list of the world's most critically endangered species.
Other turtles that come to lay eggs on the beaches may be killed by pollution, stray dogs or foxes, or captured by tourists, he said.
The World Conservation Union lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.

Scientists blame the rapid disappearance of the Arakan forest turtle  much like other shelled reptiles  on their popularity in Asia for cooking and medicinal purposes.
China is a major importer of turtles from Asia for food and medicinal purposes, and aggressive poaching in Southeast Asian countries has seen sea turtle numbers falling.

The turtles  which can be found in other parts of Asia along the Andaman Coast and the South China Sea  have seen their numbers reduced drastically in recent years mostly due to poaching of their eggs, pollution and habitat loss.
Both green and hawksbill turtles are listed as endangered by global conservation group WWF.

There have been reports of turtle deaths before, but not as many as this year, he said.
All but five of the turtles were left alive.
Hundreds of endangered sea turtles have been found dead along Bangladesh's coast over the past two weeks, triggering concerns about pollution and local fishing practices, an official said Thursday.
"We checked and we found out that there were 220 dead turtles and about 20 still alive, and three sharks," Mohamad Sueb told AFP.
On Monday, officers stopped another Chinese fishing trawler in a nearby area and discovered more than 70 green and hawksbill turtles, most of which were dead, the reports said.
The captain of the Chinese-registered trawler was fined 508,000 ringgit (147,182 dollars) and each of the crew 86,000 ringgit but they chose instead to serve the six-month terms for each of the offences, he said.
All are endangered, some, including the leatherback, critically.
There is no clear total of exactly how many turtles have died.
The turtle  which is designated as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union  since been turned over to district fisheries office and it will raised in captivity, the WWF said.
Mohamad Sueb said police believed the men were all in the same group of poachers, citing similarities in the two boats and their equipment.
"Hopefully this punishment will be a lesson for the accused and others," Mohamad Yusoff, who prosecuted the case in Sabah Magistrate's Court, told AFP.
The same court also fined nine Vietnamese fishermen 80,000 ringgit euro17,300) each for fishing illegally off Sabah.
At that price, a single nest containing about 100 eggs nets a poacher 1,000 pesos (about $90 U.S.).
The rulings were handed down Wednesday.
That's bad, very bad, as plankton is vital for healthy seas.
Some were trucked 180 miles (290 kilometers) to an aquarium and a fish hatchery near Corpus Christi when the island's tanks were filled.
Also, lights from mushrooming hotels and homes along the beaches confuse the new hatchlings, which make their way to the ocean by following moonbeams reflecting off the water.
Compare that, he says, to Mexico's minimum daily wage of 45 pesos.
Should those turtles disappear, it doesn't look so good for fish or shrimp, either.
Since that about-face, SEMARNAT (Mexico's equivalent of our Environmental Protection Agency) has operated a corral in Nuevo Vallarta, about 10 miles from Litibu, last year gathering eggs from some 4,000 turtle nests to better the hatchlings' chances for survival.
(Drexler-Price once stopped some riders to try to educate them.
She jokes that she's considered making up T-shirts with the phrase.)
The longer it takes them to reach the ocean, the slimmer their chances of ever getting there.
When the eggs hatch, which happens en masse, the newborns scurry across the beach to the sea.
In Nayarit, poachers steal the eggs for their alleged aphrodisiac effects, gulping them raw with lime and chili.
Its dietary habits ensure healthy seagrasses, where it just so happens fish lay eggs and shrimp spawn.
They've recently formalized a partnership with the nonprofit Grupo Ecologico Manos Unidas por Litibu A.C (Litibu Ecology Group).
"We want to establish the (nonprofit) before the hotels are developed, so that we can have some impact," said Susan Drexler-Price, an organizer of the grassroots homeowners group and former history teacher from Oakland, Calif. (Now, she runs the Pie in the Sky bakeries in nearby Bucerias and Puerto Vallarta.)
Sitting at a beachside restaurant not far from the nesting grounds she dreams of protecting, nibbling on chips and sipping a cool drink, Drexler-Price, a layperson, sums up.
Pollution makes them sick, literally.
There are 12 of the turtles living in captivity in the United States  at Zoo Atlanta, the St. Louis Zoo, the Miami Metro Zoo and River Banks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina.
Unfortunately, your needs and theirs may collide.
Turtles are hunted in Malaysia for their meat and shell, but many die after getting entangled in fishing nets in open seas.
Turtles are hunted in Malaysia for their meat and valuable shell, but many also die after getting entangled in fishing nets in open seas.
They were believed to be extinct for close to a century, but the turtles turned up in Asian food markets in the mid-1990s.
It was the first time the turtle species was found in Thailand in two decades, the WWF said.
Hundreds more dead turtles have been found elsewhere in the area, and on a pair of islands.
Olive ridleys, the smallest of all sea turtles, are endangered.
They often come ashore at this time of year to lay eggs, Ahmed said.
"The discovery of a species that was believed to be extinct in Thailand is considered to be a very important event and it shows that the natural habitat, in which it was found is still rich and should be conserved," the WWF's Songpol Tippayawong said.
Villagers from Klong Tum were out fishing when they spotted the turtle  about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length and weighing 28 kilograms (61.6 pounds)  as it was on its way to nest, the WWF said.
He said four of the 19 were sent back to China, but the remaining fishermen would appear before the court on Friday.
Jeff George, curator at Sea Turtle Inc., a nonprofit turtle rescue group on South Padre Island, said 42 of the endangered juvenile green turtles were released Tuesday and 46 on Wednesday.
"According to them, they can sell each turtle for 1,000 dollars US, so you can imagine how much (they make) with more than 200," he said.
Mohammad Yusoff, who represented the Sabah state fisheries department, had called for stiff sentences to deter fishermen from poaching endangered wildlife and protect the country's resources, according to the Times.
Poached eggs can fetch as much as 10 pesos apiece, says Gilberto Galindo Castro, president of the Litibu Ecology Group and a biologist.
Three species of turtle  the Olive Ridley, Hawksbill and the critically endangered Leatherback  lay their eggs on the contiguous beaches of Litibu, Malinal, Punta Negra and Careyeros, a two-mile stretch of rapidly developing white beach and rock outcrops in the Mexican state of Nayarit.
"We will try to find a safe area where there are no fishermen."
Some sea turtle species eat jellyfish like they are going out of style.
The fishermen do not properly release the turtles and often kill them, leaving them to wash ashore, he said.
"Normally, turtles caught like this would have been eaten by the local people," Songpol said.
Officers also found three live sharks and a shark skin on the vessel on Wednesday, the reports said.
"This is a serious offense," state Marine Police Chief Sueb Abdullah was quoted as saying in The Star.
Then the government said it was okay to harvest them, and their numbers plummeted.
When the government changed its mind and changed its policy beginning in 1990, Galindo Castro says the numbers went up again.
With the Mexican government's okay, expertise from biologists and backing from the expatriates, the group operates a turtle corral where the eggs can safely hatch.
In the 1960s, Galindo Castro remembers "mucho, mucho" turtles on this two-mile stretch.
His own group hopes to relocate eggs from 200 sea turtle nests in the coming season.
"We are trying to mobilize resources to make a bigger plan to save the sea turtles in the future."
Amazingly, eight to 10 years later, the female turtles return to their natal beach to lay their own eggs.
If the turtles weren't around to eat the jellyfish, the jellyfish population would explode.
"It means they're close to sexual maturity and should be migrating back to beaches in southern Mexico."
They get tangled up in commercial fishing lines and nets.
"We can't tell you exactly how (things) would fall apart, but we know enough about their diet to theorize."
Despite the jail terms, Mohamad Yusoff said he expected more poachers because of the lucrative trade in the endangered turtles for their meat and for use in traditional medicines, citing confessions from the earlier group of 17.
The Mexican government takes poaching seriously, he continued, assessing steep fines or jail time  "it's a worse offense than drugs"  but it lacks the manpower to prevent the crime in the first place or prosecute offenders in the second.
"Biologists could tell you we don't know exactly what could happen ... if they become extinct, probably something dramatic," Jeff George of Sea Turtle Inc., said during a telephone interview.
Mohamad Yusoff said four men had been released because there was no evidence of poaching, while two boys aged 16 years old and considered juveniles, would be deported.
"Both of them will be sent home immediately," he told AFP.
"Seventeen of them were arrested on board, one skipper and another 16 workers.
A total of 17 crew members were also being held for encroachment, they said.
They sold it to another villager who then alerted local conservation authorities, it said.
During egg-laying season (June-December), volunteers from the Litibu Ecology Group, many of them university students, carefully move the eggs to the corral, meticulously recording numbers and nest locations.
"The animals seem to be extremely difficult to establish in captivity," said Peter Paul van Dijk, director of the tortoise and freshwater turtle program for Conservation International.
"It's really a tragedy to lose a species that took millions of years to evolve," van Dijk said.
Sea turtles face a host of threats around the world.
"It's really sad that we couldn't protect the turtles," he said.
A team of four scientists has launched an investigation into the deaths of the olive ridley turtles, said Jafar Ahmed, a top official in the government's marine fisheries department.
(Careyeros, translates as "turtle hunter beach," indicating the turtles have come here, and men have killed them, for quite some time).
Zoo Atlanta officials said Tuesday they hatched a rare Arakan forest turtle this week, marking the fourth of the brown-and-tan spotted reptiles to be born there.
Two of the zoo's four hatchlings have died so far, and scientists say few of the turtles make it through the transport from their natural habitat to zoos and other conservation facilities.
Ahmed would not give any specific reason for the spike in deaths, but said the use of illegal fishing nets near the shoreline has apparently increased recently.
Thai villagers have caught a river terrapin turtle that was thought to be extinct in the country, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Thailand said Wednesday.
The female turtle  known for its egg-shaped shell and upturned snout  was found Jan. 3 in a mangrove canal in Phang Nga province on the country's Andaman coast, the WWF said.
Nearly 90 sea turtles rescued after a cold snap left them comatose have been returned to the Gulf of Mexico.
Yusoff confirmed his comments and the reports, but declined to say whether he thought the court's ruling had been strict enough.
At least 130 of the cold-blooded animals were rescued after being stunned by a rapid temperature drop in the island's Laguna Madre bay in mid-January.
"They said they came here together with almost 10 boats or vessels, but the police managed to apprehend only two boats," he said.
"We don't usually see greens in the 200-pound range in the Laguna Madre," George said.
Efforts in Mexico to protect sea turtles are a patchwork of official and unofficial endeavors, according to Sea Turtle, Inc., a nonprofit based in South Padre Island.
"We need to send a strong message to (the poachers) because they only think of profits and are not bothered by the laws of our country," the Times quoted Yusoff as saying.
At least 65 of the sea turtles  ranging from 40 to 60 kilograms (88 to 132 pounds)  have been found dead along a five-kilometer (three-mile) stretch of beach near Cox's Bazar, one of the main cities on Bangladesh's coast.
"The turtle was initially sold but the villager who bought it had a conservation mind-set.
Though conservationists prefer to preserve endangered animals within their natural habitats, captive breeding programs act as "as insurance policies," particularly with the demand for turtles in Asia, he said.
Rapid development endangers the turtles, too.
"Basically," she said, "it's our future."
Or suppose the sea turtle species that George described as the "lawnmower of the ocean" went extinct.
The hungry jellyfish hordes, in turn, would gorge on zooplankton.
They will be equipped with satellite transmitters to help researchers study migration patterns.
It will eventually be released back into the wild, it said.
Photos published in news reports Thursday showed the dead turtles lined up in long stretches of five rows, as marine police made an inventory of the carcasses.
The turtle, native to the Arakan hills of western Myanmar, has an abysmal survival rate.
Tourists, and locals for that matter, ride ATVs up and down the beach, potentially crushing the eggs.
You may not have flippers or a shell, but if you are among the growing number of tourists and expatriates captivated by the beautiful Pacific coastline north of Puerto Vallarta, you do have something in common with sea turtles: a taste for pristine, undeveloped, remote beaches.
With the water temperature in the 50s Fahrenheit (around 10 Celsius), the turtles' systems began shutting down, and they started washing ashore.
They return to Mexican waters when they are mature and can grow to 500 pounds (225 kilograms).
"They said they feel so sorry and they want to go home as soon as possible to look after their families," said Mohamad Yusoff.
Volunteer Jamie Perkins says only one in 1,000 will survive to adulthood.
Green turtles are born in southern Mexico and spend their early years feeding on turtle grass in shallow areas such as the Laguna Madre.
Mohammad Aminul Islam, the top administrator for the area, ordered local officials to teach people, from fishermen to tourists, to change their behavior.
Two years ago, expatriates living along those beaches began meeting over potlucks to talk about how to protect the natural turtle nursery.
Phone calls to Sueb's office for further details went unanswered Thursday morning.
