Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack.
A series of bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the northwestern Indian tourist city of Jaipur on Tuesday, killing up to 35 people and injuring many, police and news reports said.
Seven bombs ripped through a centuries-old Indian city Tuesday, leaving at least 60 people dead in a jewelry market, on the steps of a Hindu monkey god temple and in other ordinarily packed areas of the popular tourist destination.
A hospital official says at least 45 people have been killed in six bomb blasts that ripped through crowded areas of a city in western India.
Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the terrorist blasts, which killed at least 60 people and injured 150 others in Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan state Tuesday evening, the NDTV reported.

"We have information that 63 people have died and many are injured critically," she said after the blasts ripped through crowded markets on Tuesday night.
He said there was no justification for such killings.
Although Jaipur, known as the pink city, is a popular tourist destination, mid-May, the peak of the Indian summer, is not a busy season, and there were no reports that any foreigners had been killed.
"Early reports suggest six people are killed and 30 have been injured," he told reporters.
Police said at least five bombs hit markets in Jaipur, the capital of the western desert state of Rajasthan, and put their initial estimate of the toll at six.
The blasts all struck within the old walls of Jaipur, a city in western India that's known for its pink-hued palaces, and suspicion quickly fell on Islamic militant groups blamed for a string of attacks on India in recent years.
Another 100 people have reportedly been wounded in Tuesday's attacks.
Jain, said 60 people were killed and 150 wounded in the bombings.
Indian police on Wednesday arrested two men after eight near-simultaneous bombings killed 63 people and wounded 216 in the Rajasthan tourist city of Jaipur, the state's chief minister said.
In the first terrorist attack in many months, seven bombs went off within minutes of one another on Tuesday evening in the crowded lanes of one of India's main tourist hubs, the historic city of Jaipur, with reports of deaths ranging from 50 upward, with roughly 150 injured, officials said.
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband on Tuesday condemned the near- simultaneous bombings in the Indian city of Jaipur that killed at least 80 people.
Serial blasts rocked crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled tourist city.
"We have information that 80 people have died," Rajasthan state home minister Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters.
"According to the information I have received, 60 people have died and 150 have been injured," said Chief Minister of Rajasthan Jaipur Vasundhara Raje.
The United States condemned terrorist attacks in western India "that have killed and injured many innocent civilians," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said Tuesday.
The blasts went off within minutes of each other close to several Hindu temples in what police said was a terror attack on the city 260 kilometres (160 miles) west of the Indian capital.
Police said seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other during the evening in crowded markets of old walled Jaipur, about 260 kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
Rajasthan Director General of Police A. S. Gill said it was " obviously a terror attack".
Government officials usually blame Islamic militants based in Pakistan for such attacks, which have plagued India in recent years.
India's junior home minister Shriprakash Jaiswal told reporters "the people responsible for these attacks have foreign connections," without naming Pakistan.
Junior home minister Shriprakash Jaiswal told reporters, "The people responsible for these attacks have foreign connections," but he refused to point a finger directly at traditional foe Pakistan.
"Obviously, it's a terrorist plot," said A.S. Gill, the police chief of Rajasthan, the state where Jaipur is located.
No claims of responsibility were reported.
Another blast took place near the Johari Bazaar  the city's jewelry market, a popular destination for tourists.
A.S. Gill, a top police official, says six explosions took place in markets and several other areas of the historic city located in a region dotted with palaces and ancient cities that draw hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every year.
India has been plagued by bombings across the country in recent years and routinely points the finger at foreign-based Islamic militant groups fighting its rule in the Himalayan state of Kashmir.

One live bomb was found attached to a bicycle at one of the explosion sites and was defused, police said.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner Tuesday expressed revulsion at bomb blasts in Jaipur that claimed at least 80 lives, and offered to step up help to India in fighting terrorism.
The first explosion was about 7:30 p.m. near a temple dedicated to the Hindu god Hanuman that is especially crowded on Tuesday evenings.
One of the explosions went off near a packed Hindu temple, leaving pools of blood outside in the street and cycles and rickshaws in a mangled heap, television pictures showed.
Jaipur, Rajasthan's capital, is popular with foreign and domestic tourists but there were few in the city in mid-May, the hot season in northern India.
There were no claims of responsibility, which is typical of terrorist attacks in India.
There was no (intelligence) report of this," said police director general A.S. Gill.
Shortly after the bombings, authorities put New Delhi, India's capital, and Mumbai, the country's financial center, on high alert along with several other cities.
But within hours of the blasts, authorities were suggesting that blame would eventually fall on Pakistan and the Islamic militant groups New Delhi accuses it of backing.
Within just the last year they have included bombings in the southern city of Hyderabad which killed 43 people, at a cinema in Punjab state in northern India which left six dead, and a series of explosions outside courts in three northern cities that killed 13.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm, while the United States immediately condemned the wave of bombings.
"France is more than ever willing to intensify cooperation with India in the anti-terrorist struggle," said Kouchner following the Tuesday bomb blasts at markets in the northern Indian tourist city.
The blasts began around 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT), and one hit a market near a temple dedicated to the Hindu monkey god Hanuman.
But Indian authorities have blamed Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups for a spate of bombings that have killed nearly 400 people in this predominantly Hindu country of 1.1 billion people since 2005.
Pakistan-based Islamic militants and fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir are usually blamed for such attacks.
World capitals from Washington to Paris and London condemned the attacks, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also voiced his "outrage."
"We were looking for him all evening," said his uncle Jagdish Kumar Gathera, who found him at the hospital.
Panic set in immediately, officials said.
We don't want Jaipur's economy to go down," said Manoj Sharma, a New Delhi travel agent.
By then, he hopes, fears will have faded.
Associated Press reporters Sam Dolnick, Muneeza Naqvi and Ashok Sharma in New Delhi contributed to this report.
"I felt like I was hit by lightning and I couldn't really figure out what was happening," the father of five told AFP at the same hospital, a blood-stained bandage around his arm.
"Then I saw a woman's body go flying through the air.
Still, it'll be months before temperatures in Rajasthan dip below 100 degrees and the high season for tourists begins.
Among those detained in the city, which was under a day-time curfew, were one of the wounded and a rickshaw puller, a police official said.
"He strongly condemns such terrorist attacks, and sends his heartfelt sympathies to the Government of India and to the families of the victims," his spokesman said in a statement.
The tourist season, however, ended in March and there were no immediate indications that foreigners had been caught in the explosions.
Kataria had initially put the death toll at 80 and 200 injured while the Press Trust of India reported an "unofficial" toll of 85 dead.
"One suspect was detained and is being investigated," he added in Jaipur, the state capital.
Seven blasts occurred within minutes of each other, tearing apart markets, in what Indian police described as a "terror attack."
The police sealed off Jaipur's walled city, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed for calm.
Historic Jaipur, which has a population of more than two million, is one of India's top tourist resorts and a favourite for foreigners.
"It's a terror attack," police director general Amorjot Singh Gill said.
The attacks have run the gamut from the July 2006 train bombings that left nearly 200 people dead in Mumbai, India's financial center, to small blasts like the one that struck a Muslim shrine in Rajasthan last year, killing two people.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm, as the government issued a nationwide security alert.
There was no (intelligence) report of this," police director general A.S. Gill told reporters.
"The way it has been done, the attempt was to cause the maximum damage to human life," he said, adding an eighth bomb was found and defused by police.
Several of the explosions took place along the walled city's Johari bazaar, a strip of shops housed in pink buildings that are the hallmark of Jaipur, known as the pink city.
Cities across India have been bombed repeatedly in recent years and analysts say Islamic extremist groups are attempting to stoke sectarian tensions to derail a peace process with Pakistan and damage India's booming economy.
While no foreigners appeared to have been caught in Tuesday's attack, "We are all nervous.
"We have arrested two people and have detained several (more) people for questioning," Vasundhara Raje told a press conference.
Rohit Singh, the spokesman for Rajasthan state, of which Jaipur is the capital, estimated the death toll to be over 50 about three hours after the explosions.
Press Trust of India, which said 200 had been injured, quoted a statement from Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani saying his country, "condemns all acts of terrorism and reaffirms its firm commitment to fight this scourge together with the international community."
"The United States stands with the government and people of India in their ongoing fight to eliminate the scourge terrorism," McCormack said.
Ten-year-old Kanha Mahar had gone to a temple to the Hindu deity Hanuman on a traditional day to pray to the monkey god.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm.
Miliband said Britain "stands and will continue to stand with the government and people of India against terrorism in all its manifestations."
No one claimed responsibility for the attack, as is the case with most bombings in India.
One of the blasts took place near a temple, where cycles and rickshaws lay in a mangled heap, television pictures showed.
A seventh bomb was defused before it exploded, he says.
Tuesday is the day of worship set aside for Hanuman, and the temple was packed with people offering prayers on the way home from work.
The government also issued a nationwide security alert, particularly in New Delhi, where roadblocks were set up on major roads, and the financial capital Mumbai.
"We are trying our best to unravel the conspiracy behind this dastardly attack," he said.
Timing devices were used," she said.
Parikshit Bhandari, who saw the attack near the jewelry market, said there was "blood all around and wounded people crawling on the ground."
Among the 80 dead were a 10-year-old boy at the Hanuman (monkey god) temple, a bride in a bright red saree still wearing marriage bangles and a young man covered in blood who was left hanging over the twisted wreckage of a bicycle rickshaw, the Press Trust of India said.
On Wednesday morning, the superintendent of the main government hospital also said the toll was over 50.
Shekhawat, the superintendent of the Sawai Man Singh hospital in Jaipur, where most of the bodies were taken, says at least 45 people have died.
"This seems to have been done by some international group," the chief minister added.
Each new bombing has brought fears of a fresh outbreak of the violence between Hindus and Muslims that has sporadically bled India throughout its history, and authorities appealed for calm in the wake of Tuesday's attack.
Scores of people were taken to hospital in Jaipur, some 260 kilometres (160 miles) from New Delhi.
Police called it a "terrorist" bombing.
Historic Jaipur, which has a population of more than two million, is one of India's top tourist resorts and a favourite attraction for foreigners.
Two years ago, serial blasts along the commuter train line in Mumbai, India's commercial capital, killed nearly 200.
The city is one of the major attractions in Rajasthan, a desert region dotted with palaces and temples that draw hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every year, from bargain-hunting backpackers to celebrities like Mick Jagger.
The Indian federal government dispatched explosives experts from the National Security Group, and put several major cities on alert, including New Delhi.
Jaipur is popularly known as the 'pink city' because of the ochre-pink hue of its hill top forts, Hindu maharajah's palaces and crenellated city walls.
It is popularly known as the 'pink city' because of the ochre-pink hue of its old buildings and crenellated city walls.
Jaiswal suggested Tuesday's bombings were connected to those previous explosions, saying "the blasts are part of a big conspiracy."
"My thoughts are with the families of the victims and with those injured.
Seven women and 10 children were among the dead, Raje said.
State home minister Gulab Chand Kataria had earlier told AFP around a dozen people had been detained.
Another senior Rajasthan police officer, A.K.
The eight bombs were believed to have been planted on bicycles, police said, and released a sketch of a suspect they wanted to question.
The bombs were within a radius of 50 feet, the police said, and may have been planted in the wheels of bicycles, the mangled remains of which were found near many of the blast sites.
In October last year, an explosion killed six people and wounded 32 in a packed cinema hall in Ludhiana in Punjab state in northern India.
A series of explosions outside courts in three northern cities killed 13 last November.
Schools and government offices shut Wednesday in a day of mourning across the desert state.
But the junior minister for home affairs, Sriprakash Jaiswal, immediately said "foreign terrorists" were suspected, a phrase understood to refer to India's neighbor and nuclear rival, Pakistan.
"One can't rule out the involvement of a foreign power," said India's junior home minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal, using language commonly understood to refer to neighboring Pakistan.
Singh, the state spokesman, said that it was too early to say who was responsible, but that the attack, on a summer's evening when the walled city was thronged, appeared to be intended to ignite religious fury between Hindus and Muslims.
In August, 43 people were killed and 70 injured in the southern city of Hyderabad when attackers triggered blasts at an outdoor auditorium and a popular eatery.
Jaiswal refused to say if he was indeed talking about Pakistan  "that's the subject of investigation," was all he would say.
The last major bombing in India was in August, when a pair of bombs went off in an outdoor auditorium and restaurant in the southern city of Hyderabad, killing more than 40.
In Jaipur hospital wards and at the morgue, the dead included Hindus and Muslims, a strong minority in the city, an AFP reporter said.
Shopping bags, bloodied sandals and shoes were strewn around Johri bazaar, one of the hit markets, which security forces cleared quickly for fear of further blasts.
New Delhi, Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh have been put on high alert after the Indian Home Ministry raised a nation-wide alert following the serial bomb blasts.
Pakistan, an overwhelmingly Muslim country, denies any role in the bombings.
Pakistan routinely denies Indian accusations that it is involved in any way in attacks on India.
Analysts say Islamic extremist groups are attempting to stoke sectarian tensions to derail an India-Pakistan peace process and damage the country's booming economy.
"RDX and ammonium nitrate were used.
Ball-bearings were used, which have weight, and they behave like tiny missiles.
"We're still collecting some information about this.
"I wish to express my indignation and repugnance at the wave of attacks that have plunged the city of Jaipur into mourning," he said in a statement.
But given the facts that we know now, quite clearly these bombs were intended to claim innocent life and it's something that we very clearly condemn," US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
The NDTV station however put the toll at 35 people dead, citing police, but that could not be independently confirmed.
"I heard two explosions... then a bomb went off right in front of me," said Malchand Bagoria, who runs a fruit stall opposite one of the bomb sites.
State borders were sealed and a high alert sounded in Rajasthan state and neighbouring areas, police said.
Television channels showed footage of mangled bicycles, damaged cars and overturned bicycle rickshaws, the most popular mode of transport in the crowded lanes of Jaipur.
The Hindu holy city of Varanasi was struck by a pair of bombings in March 2006, killing 14, and a blast killed two worshipers in one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Ajmer, also in Rajasthan, last September.
Security was also quickly stepped up at airports and railway stations across the country.
The bombings took place as India marked the 10th anniversary of nuclear tests conducted on May 13 in Rajasthan, but it was unclear if there was any link.
Similar terrorist attacks aimed at religious sites in recent years have not succeeded in setting off sectarian violence.
"Today we are at the side of India and the Indian people in the face of this inconceivable horror," said the minister.
"We wish to assure the Indian government of our full support."
Hospitals in Jaipur asked for blood donations.
Gathera and other relatives looked on in shocked silence as Mahar's body was taken off a rusty gurney, leaving behind a pool of blood.
"Today's bombings in Jaipur have shown again the horrific destruction which terrorism brings," Miliband said in a statement.
Six more were in quick succession in the warrens of shops and monuments nearby, including the popular 18th-century tourist site called Hawa Mahal, and the Johri Bazaar, lined with jewelers.
There can never be any justification for acts of indiscriminate violence such as these, and I utterly condemn those who have perpetrated today's attacks."
Muhammad Farid, 29, was heading home from work when the blasts hit.
