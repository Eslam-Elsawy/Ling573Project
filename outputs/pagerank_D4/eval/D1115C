A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with another vessel in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday and leaked about 15,000 tons of crude oil, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
A crane-carrying vessel slammed into a Hong Kong-registered oil tanker in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday causing the tanker to leak about 110,000 barrels of crude oil, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker leaked 10,810 tons, or 66,000 barrels, of crude oil off South Korea's stormy west coast on Friday, officials said, in what was estimated to be the nation's largest maritime oil spill.
A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea Friday after being holed by a barge in what officials said was South Korea's worst oil spill.
The tanker was at anchor and carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil  about 1.8 million barrels  to be loaded into boats from a nearby port when it was hit by the South Korean barge which was being towed by a small tug boat, Kim said.
The tanker was at anchor about 8 kilometers (5 miles) off Mallipo beach, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil  or about 1.8 million barrels  when it was hit by another vessel that was carrying a crane, the ministry official said.

About 66,000 barrels (10.5 million 2.7 million gallons) of crude oil gushed from the 146,000-ton Hong Kong-registered ship after a crane-carrying vessel slammed into it at around 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT Thursday), the Coast Guard said.
A tanker spilled more than 10,000 tons of crude oil into the Yellow Sea after it was holed by a barge Friday in what officials said was South Korea's worst ever oil spill.
South Korea's Coast Guard said Friday it stopped oil leaking from a supertanker in seas near South Korea's west coast and was cleaning up what appeared to be the country's largest offshore spill.
The tanker was at anchor about 8 kilometers (5 miles) off Mallipo beach, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil  or about 1.8 million barrels  when it was hit by another vessel that was carrying a crane, the first ministry official said.

The tanker was at anchor, carrying about 260,000 tons of crude oil  or about 1.8 million barrels  when the accident happened.
The previously largest oil spill in South Korea happened in 1995 when about 5,035 tons  about 35,000 barrels  of crude and fuel oil was leaked, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
About 10.5 million liters of crude oil leaked to waters off the western coast of South Korea on Friday after an oil tanker and a barge collided early on the day and became the largest offshore oil spill in South Korea.
The collision at around 7:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Thursday) left holes in three containers aboard the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit, leading to what was believed to be South Korea's largest offshore oil leak, a Maritime and Fisheries Ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity, citing office policy.

A spill in 1995, previously considered the largest, happened when about 5,035 tons  about 35,000 barrels  of crude and fuel oil was leaked.
In the previous largest offshore oil spill in South Korea, an oil tanker spilled 30,740 barrels of crude and fuel off the south coast in 1995, costing 96 billion won, or $101 million, in cleanup operations and damages to fishermen.
Friday's accident is the largest offshore oil spill in South Korea.
A spill in 1995, previously considered the largest, involved a leak of about 5,035 tons  about 35,000 barrels  of crude and fuel oil.
He said the leaked oil was about 15,000 tons or about 110,000 barrels  which is equivalent to 17.4 million liters (4.6 million gallons).
The tanker was at anchor when the South Korean barge ship hit into the larboard of the oil tanker and punctured three holes in the tanker.
The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest, according to the Coast Guard and the Maritime Ministry.
The spill was believed to be South Korea's largest, according to the Coast Guard and the ministry.
The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.
The spill occurred when a vessel carrying a crane crashed into the 147,000-ton tanker Hebei Spirit on Friday morning about 5 nautical miles off the coast near Taean, 90 miles southwest of Seoul.
The spill released about 66,000 barrels (10.5 million 2.7 million gallons), said Coast Guard officer Jung Se-hi.
Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Seoul, said 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters were involved in the operation, with efforts focused on cleanup after the leak had been stopped.
The size of the leak reported by the authorities would be about one-fourth that of the 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons, of oil spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.
The slick was 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) long and 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
Oil from a damaged supertanker has reached South Korea's western shore, a Coast Guard official said Saturday, deepening fears of environmental damage from the country's largest oil spill.
In the previous worst incident in South Korea, a tanker hit a rock in 1995 and spilt 5,000 tones of oil onto the south coast, causing damage estimated at 44.3-billion won (48-million dollars).

The Coast Guard dispatched 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters to stop the spread of the spill and collect the oil, Jung said.
The collision left three holes in the 146,000-ton tanker Hebbei Spirit, leading to the leak, a ministry official said.
South Korea's Coast Guard dispatched dozens of ships Friday to prevent crude oil that leaked from a supertanker from reaching an ecologically sensitive shoreline on the country's west coast.
The accident occurred at 07:15 a.m. local time (2215 GMT Thursday) in waters 6 miles northwest off the seashore of Taean Peninsula, South Chungcheon Province when the 146,000-ton tanker Hebei Sprit collided with a South Korean barge ship, the maritime police said.
In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker released about 260,000 barrels, or 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in what turned into a major environmental disaster.

Another ministry official said that spills from two containers were stopped about three hours after the collision, but oil was still leaking from the third container.
According to the coast guard, the Hebei Spirit was registered in Hong Kong, while the barge ship belongs to a South Korean company.
The spill triggered an emergency operation by about 40 coastguard and other ships as well as four helicopters, said maritime ministry officials.
In 1995, a 144,567-ton tanker, the Sea Prince, struck a reef and released 5,035 tons of oil in waters off the south coast of the country.
The oil had been spewing from three holes on the tanker's port side.
The federation's offices have taken numerous calls from people worried about a potential environmental disaster.

Kim added that the Coast Guard would later question the barge's captain to find why he was sailing through the area despite the stormy weather.
The site was about 6 nautical miles (7 11 kilometers) off Mallipo beach, approximately 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Seoul, the Coast Guard said.

It was unclear if any of the leaked oil had reached the shore, the Coast Guard's Jung said.
About 7 kilometers (4 miles) of coastline near Mallipo beach, approximately 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Seoul, has been affected by the oil, said Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at the Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon.
Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Seoul, said the clean up operation would likely take at least three or four days.
Environmental and other damage from Friday's spill would likely be less compared with 1995, said Jang Ki-pyo, a Maritime and Fisheries Ministry official, as the leaked oil would be quickly frozen during cold winter temperatures and because the accident took place about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from shore.
The maritime police estimates that about 10.5 million liters of crude oil leak from the holes and spread to an area of 2 km wide and 7.4 km long.
The spill triggered an emergency operation by about 40 coastguard and other ships as well as four helicopters, said maritime ministry officials who have set up a crisis centre.
The ministry said dozens of vessels in other regions had been asked to join the operation.
"We have set up a boom, trying to stop oil from spreading along the coast, but oil sometimes overflows, it depends on the currents."

In 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker released about 240,000 barrels of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound, causing a major environmental disaster.
One of the worst oil spillages in the world from a tanker was in 1978, when the Amoco Cadiz spewed 220,000 tons off the coast of northwest France.
The accident occurred at 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT Thursday), the Coast Guard said.
Kim said that some of the spilled oil had been collected, though he could not say how much.
The Coast Guard said 46 ships, including navy and other government vessels, plus four helicopters, were involved in the operation.
"If we fail to contain the spread, it is feared (it will) inflict serious damage to the coast," he said.
In March 1989 the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez leaked 38,800 tones of crude into Prince William Sound in Alaska, the worst spill in US history.
We have 40 vessels out there fighting the oil spill."
"Oil is still spewing from three holes on the tanker's port side.
It said operations had been hampered by strong winds and the danger of an explosion.
The region is popular for its scenic beaches, and is also the site of fish farms, a national maritime park and an important rest stop for migrating birds.
"If we fail to contain the spread, it is feared (it will) inflict serious damage to the coast."
Lee Woo-Sung, an official at a crisis centre set up by the ministry, said the tanker was no longer leaking after spilling an estimated 10,500 tons, but clean- up crews would continue working overnight.
Cho Sung-won, a regional Coast Guard spokesman, said the leak was stopped at around noon (0300 GMT).

"If oil reaches the shore it will cause enormous long-term damage to the environment along the coast, which is also dotted with many seaweed and oyster farms.
Chang Geun-ho, a ministry official, said the extent of environmental damage would depend on the success of the containment operation, though he added that cold winter temperatures could help slow the spread of the oil slick by freezing it.
The barge, which had a crane on board, was being towed by another vessel at the time of the accident.
Yonhap news agency said the tow rope broke in strong winds and high waves.

The leakage was stopped by late afternoon and work was concentrated on cleaning up the spill, Jung said.
The ministry said the spillage might be greater than the estimated 10,000 tons.
The collision caused three gashes in the tanker's hull.
In addition, the government spent more than 22-billion won on a five-month operation to clean up the south coast.
However, no casualties were reported during the accident.
"The area is ecologically important as migrant birds gather there during winter," Bok told AFP.
It is also home to a national maritime park and an important refueling stop for migratory birds.

The barge, which had a crane onboard to build a bridge in the western port city of Incheon, was being towed by another vessel.
The South Korean Defense Ministry said Friday it has dispatched 500 soldiers in four Navy boats to assist with the containment efforts.
Three small tankers were sent to pump the remaining oil from the single-hull tanker.
The west coast is one of Asia's largest wetland areas.
Photographs released by the maritime ministry showed crude oil spurting from the holes.
The 1995 leak, which occurred in July, caused an estimated 73.5 billion won, at today's exchange rates equal to US$80 million (euro55 million), in damage.

Jung said it was unclear how serious the contamination was.
Authorities battled to contain the oil inside a boom some eight kilometres (five miles) long to prevent it damaging the coastline, as a fleet of 28 ships scattered dispersant chemicals or tried to pump up the spillage.
"Much will depend on how the sea currents move in coming hours.
The barge, which was moving from a construction site, lost control after a wire linking it to the tug boat was cut due to high winds, waves and currents, he said.
A slick of spilt oil stretches five kilometres, threatening marine farms in the region," Kim said.

Strong winds and prevailing currents meant oil was expected to start washing up on shore as early as Saturday morning and flow into fishing grounds and fishing farms, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
In March 1967, the Torrey Canyon tanker spilled 119,000 tons of crude off Britain's Scilly Isles,
The South Korean government sent 57 vessels and 4 helicopters to the spot soon after the accident to prevent further spreading of the floating oil.
In addition, the government spent more than 22-billion won on a five-month operation to clean up the shoreline.
"Our initial investigation showed loose ropes linked to the towing vessel might have caused the accident," Kim told AFP.

The stretchy of west coast is one of Asia's largest wetland areas, and Bok Jin- Ho, of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement, said it has sent a team to check damage.
The official, who also did not give his name, said the amount of the spilled oil could change.
Earlier, ministry officials had cited a larger figure of about 110,000 barrels for the spill.
The extent of its potential damage to communities or wildlife in the area was not immediately clear, the official said.
Wetlands are very vulnerable to pollution."
