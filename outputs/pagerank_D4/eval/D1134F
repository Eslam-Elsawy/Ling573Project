The women who received valacyclovir also had half as many copies of HIV in their genital tracts compared to those who received the placebo, suggesting that valacyclovir has the potential to reduce the spread of HIV, Mayaud said.
Treating genital herpes can also help keep the AIDS virus under control in women with both infections, and might reduce the spread of HIV as well, the first major study to test this strategy suggests.
"If the rate we saw in our study translates across sub-Saharan Africa, we're looking at more than 8,000,000 people in this region with HIV dementia," says Sacktor.
More than half of all new infections with the AIDS virus in Africa involve women and girls.
A study carried out by British researchers has revealed that a drug designed to combat genital herpes can reduce levels of HIV in the blood by 70 percent and also appears to reduce levels of HIV in the genital tract.
The trials' results were announced by their researchers last year.
One study involving 1,500 women in South Africa, Benin, Uganda, and India was stopped this week after an independent safety monitoring board saw more HIV infections among women using the gel than those given a dummy medication.
The World Health Organization has reported that the number of countries with XDR tuberculosis has increased from 17 in March to 28 at present.
The trials, conducted in Kenya and Uganda and earlier in South Africa, found that men who were uncircumcised were twice as likely to catch the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with circumcised counterparts.
But he also said that manufacturing medication used to treat HIV/AIDS is sparse in Africa and the continent needs to increase its own production because "HIV is going to be with us for a very long time."
Many people with HIV are also infected with the herpes type 2 virus, and scientists have long known that herpes sores on the genitals can make it easier to become infected with the AIDS virus and could increase the risk of transmitting HIV to others.
In the latest study, conducted in Africa and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, women who took the herpes drug valacyclovir had less HIV in their blood and in their genital secretions.
But Africa also struggles with high rates of tuberculosis and malaria infection.
Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
Last year, 2.8 million people in sub-Saharan Africa became infected with HIV, and 2.1 million people died.
Researchers have halted two studies of an anti-AIDS vaginal gel in Africa and India after early results suggested it might raise the risk of HIV infection instead of lowering it.
In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS welcomed publication of the trials in Kenya and Uganda.
The researchers led by Philippe Mayaud recruited 140 women infected with both HIV and herpes in the West African nation of Burkina Faso and gave half of the women valacyclovir and the other half women placebo pills for three months.
An international study led by Johns Hopkins University suggests on Monday that the rate of HIV-related dementia is so high in sub-Saharan Africa that HIV dementia along with Alzheimer's disease and dementia from strokes may be among the most common forms of dementia in the world.
The researchers found that copies of HIV in those who received valacyclovir had dropped from 25,000 copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 per milliliter - a 70 percent reduction and levels of HIV found in the blood of women who received the placebo, by comparison, had increased slightly on average.
The herpes medication, valacyclovir, and other herpes drugs, might dramatically reduce the spread of HIV, according to the researchers.
Researchers testing cellulose sulphate found that women who used the gel ran a higher risk of HIV infection compared with those who used a dummy lookalike, or placebo.
The two U.S. studies confirm similar results from an earlier trial in South Africa.
In areas where HIV is spread primarily through heterosexual sex, such as sub-Saharan Africa, male circumcision could theoretically slash the infection rate in half.
South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of HIV infections, with more than 5.5 million out of the overall 47 million population affected by the virus.
Of the estimated 40 million adults and children worldwide who are living with HIV infection, an estimated 27 million live in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Sacktor.
"But we also found no evidence that the product was effective."
In the study, 140 women from the West African nation of Burkina Faso who were infected with the both the herpes and AIDS viruses received either valacyclovir or dummy pills for three months.
A similar trial involving cellulose sulphate was stopped in Nigeria as a precaution, although there was no data to suggest that there was any risk.
There are 40,000 new HIV infections in the U.S. each year and 4.3 million new cases worldwide.
The second study of Ushercell, by Family Health International, involving 1,700 women in Nigeria, was stopped as a precaution.
He said there are large numbers of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis cases in China, Russia and India, providing more opportunities for the development of XDR tuberculosis.
"This is an extraordinary development," said Dr. Kevin de Cock, director of the World Health Organization's AIDS department.
"This is an additional tool, and it must not replace other interventions," said de Cock, who added that there will be no push for universal circumcision.
"We need to protect people from such infections that are happening in hospitals, homes and everywhere in the country so that no one gets away with infecting another person deliberately," she said.
Building health care systems is among its top challenges, he said.
"Access is not just about drugs, it's about services," he said.
Gawanas said "HIV has a woman's face," referring to the prevalence of the disease among women compared to men, and that dealing with social issues is also among top priorities in the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS.
Mayaud stressed the need for long-term studies of valacyclovir' s effect on HIV infection.
Scientists say conclusive data shows there is no question circumcision reduces men's chances of catching HIV by up to 60 percent  a finding experts are hailing as a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS.
Given the recent failure of a microbicide trial in Africa and India, and the ongoing difficulties in developing an AIDS vaccine, the potential of circumcision as a new weapon against HIV has become even more significant.
The treatment group was also less likely to have HIV in their genital tract  13 percent had detectable virus levels during each visit, compared with 27 percent in the placebo group.
They calculate that in KwaZulu-Natal province, where HIV incidence is very high but circumcision rates very low, 35,000 new infections could have been prevented in 2007 alone if the 2.5 million men there had been circumcised.
Researchers recently found that circumcision lowers the risk of spreading HIV, and they hope the same will prove true of treating herpes.
The findings first were announced in December, when initial results from two major trials  in Kenya and Uganda  showed promising links between circumcision and HIV transmission.
The data were so dramatic that the trials in Kenya and Uganda were halted ahead of schedule, for it would have been ethically wrong to continue them.
And in Uganda, 2,474 circumcised men were compared to 2,522 men who were not.
Trials showing that male circumcision more than halves the risk of HIV infection are published in The Lancet on Friday, giving the seal of approval to calls for circumcision to be cautiously launched as an AIDS prevention strategy.
"Male circumcision has major potential for the prevention of HIV infection," said Kevin De Cock, director of the WHO's HIV/AIDS department.
The results were confirmed by further tests carried out by the United States' National Institutes of Health and published Friday in The Lancet.
A highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis has killed about 85 percent of South African HIV patients who have become infected, presenting one of the most worrisome problems in HIV and tuberculosis control, researchers reported Sunday.
The outbreak began in KwaZulu-Natal province last year and is found throughout the country, she said.
"Male circumcision is such a sensitive religious and cultural issue that we need to be careful," she said.
However, they said such treatment could be useful in preventing HIV transmission in Third World countries without access to modern AIDS drugs.
The region is home to over 60 percent of all people living with HIV.
In recent years, the fight against the AIDS pandemic has focused on the provision of lifesaving drugs.
The study is designed to test effectiveness.
"Clearly, large-scale testing would have to be conducted before we know the global reach of HIV dementia, but this study sends a clear message that it exists in high proportions in sub-Saharan Africa and is an under-recognized condition that needs to be studied and treated," Sacktor says.
After tracking the men for two years, scientists found that circumcised men were 51 to 60 percent less likely to contract HIV than their uncircumcised counterparts.
Sacktor says an extremely high rate of HIV dementia in Africa and other poor regions of the world adds enormously to the social and economic burden of their populations and governments.
Researchers believe that valacyclovir indirectly reduces HIV infection by decreasing copies of the herpes virus and note that untreated herpes can cause lesions in the genital region, which subsequently attract a type of immune cell that harbors HIV.
Unlike Alzheimer's- and stroke-induced dementia, HIV dementia is treatable and potentially reversible with the same antiretroviral medication that is used to treat the infection.
It was announced by the World Health Organisation last week that two out of six advanced trials of the vaginal microbicides gels had been stopped for safety reasons.
Since the studies were stopped, all the men have been offered the opportunity to be circumcised.
A larger study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is under way that aims to be the definitive word on whether treating herpes patients with acyclovir, the first herpes drug, can slow down HIV transmission.
Apart from South Africa, the trial had also been conducted in India, Uganda and Benin.
The Gates Foundation is financing that experiment as well as research on a microbicide containing tenofovir, a drug already used to treat AIDS that is showing potential as an HIV preventive.
XDR tuberculosis has appeared in the U.S. but at much lower levels.
"We remain hopeful that a safe and effective microbicide will be developed," said a statement by Nicholas Hellmann, acting director of the Gates foundation's HIV program.
The impoverished southern African country, whose total number of HIV infected people currently stands at about 1 million, has about 170,000 infected people who require HIV/AIDS drugs.
The study was led by CONRAD, a Virginia-based health research group, and paid for by the United States Agency for International Development, and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation.
WHO and UNAIDS have convened an international meeting in early March to examine the results of the new trials and assess their impact on AIDS policies.
About 330 cases of extensively drug-resistant, or ``XDR,'' tuberculosis have been verified in South Africa over the past year, said Karin Weyer of the South African Medical Research Council in Pretoria.
She said Malawi needed an HIV/AIDS law that would ably protect people from malicious HIV infection especially in cases of rape or other sexual abuses, adding that the current legal framework had huge loopholes in addressing such issues.
"We should go back to the basics: that primary health care is what Africa needs," Gawanas said.
Shawa could not however state how soon Malawi would have the HIV/AIDS law in place but said the country should have formulated the law some years back.
The top priority in Africa should be getting people basic health care and not just dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, an African Union commissioner said.
One of the study's authors, Dr. Philippe Mayaud of the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine, called for more research on herpes control methods, including the development of a herpes vaccine.
Twenty-two women who took part in recent trials for a gel designed to prevent HIV infection during intercourse have contracted the virus, South Africa's health ministry said on Wednesday.
It was "a disappointing and unexpected setback" to efforts to get a simple tool to protect women from the risk of AIDS through sex, the World Health Organization said.
This is the same effect one would expect if the women had been given an anti-HIV drug such as Zidovudine (AZT), according to Mayaud.
"We did not find any evidence of greater risk of HIV infection," said a statement from Dr. Vera Halpern, who led the Nigeria study.
The cellulose sulphate, also called Ushercell, was in Phase III trials, the final and biggest step in testing a pharmaceutical innovation for safety and effectiveness.
Now, a modeling study projects that in the next decade, male circumcision could prevent 2 million AIDS infections and 300,000 deaths.
Malawi, whose population currently stands at about 12 million, loses 80,000 people every year to HIV/AIDS and about 110,000 people catch HIV annually.
"We hope studies like these will shed additional light on the devastating problem of HIV in resource-limited countries like Uganda and encourage more programs that bring much-needed medication to these poor regions of the world," Sacktor says.
The country has however managed to increase the number of people receiving free anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) from about 4, 000 two years ago to 80,000 at present.
In the Kenyan study, 1,391 circumcised men were compared to 1,393 who were not.
"Circumcision is the most potent intervention in HIV prevention that has been described."
Participants were not taking other AIDS medications.
"We are investigating whether these women were infected as a result of the use of the microbicide, Ushercell," added Mngadi.
"We have found that about 22 women from the 604 participants at the trial site in KwaZulu-Natal were infected by the AIDS virus," health spokesman, Sibani Mngadi told AFP.
U.N.-led efforts to solve the problems one by one lose effectiveness as they encounter complex maladies among people in Africa, Gawanas said.
The operation is cheap, whereas treatment for HIV infection entails a lifelong dependence on expensive drugs.
Doctors took vaginal swabs and drew blood samples twice a week to measure HIV levels.
HIV dementia is defined as memory, learning, behavioral and motor disabilities that interfere with normal daily life and in extreme cases lead to total disability and a bedridden state.
Now, the question is how to put that fact to work to combat AIDS across Africa.
The theory behind circumcision's protective effect is that the foreskin has a very thin epithelium, or lining, and easily suffers minor abrasions during intercourse.
It is the largest scientific gathering for researchers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Prof. Babatunde Osotimehin, chairman of Nigeria's National Action Committee on AIDS, said Africa has suffered a "decay" in its infrastructure.
Botched operations and the temptations of unsafe sex could squander a historic opportunity, it said.
The study looked at 178 subjects in Kampala, Uganda, from September 2003 to January 2004.
Some of the most affected areas include South Africa, South Korea and parts of Eastern Europe, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
``We increasingly live in small world,'' he said.
The death rate is still six times higher than the typical rate for tuberculosis, he said.
Some AIDS specialists said it is unlikely herpes drugs will be the first line of defense against AIDS.
Scientists and groups like the Gates Foundation have long sought a method of protection women could use, even without their partners' knowledge, since many men refuse to use condoms.
Those who took the drug ended up with less HIV in the bloodstream, with their count dropping from an average 20,000 virus copies per milliliter of blood to 8,000 copies.
Circumcision has long been suspected of reducing men's susceptibility to HIV infection because the cells in the foreskin of the penis are especially vulnerable to the virus.
The placebo group saw their HIV levels spike, from an average of 50,000 virus copies per milliliter of blood to 63,000.
The study involved researchers from France, England and Burkina Faso and was funded by the French national AIDS research agency, ANRS.
As a precaution, another trial using this compound was stopped.
In addition to being preventive, circumcision also carries cost benefits.
Dr. Paul Nunn, coordinator of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus at the World Health Organization, called the 85 percent mortality rate ``completely egregious.''
And all the men were warned not to lapse into sexually risky behavior, such as abandoning condom use.
Weyer said the disease appears in about 10 percent of patients with a less severe form of tuberculosis known as ``multi-drug resistant.''
Since 1993, there have been 47 cases in the U.S., resulting in 13 deaths, said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) and TB Prevention.
"We also are investigating whether the participants were given sufficient information to make informed decisions about their participation."
Governments and doctors have to tread carefully in advising circumcision, they said.
African health systems are already overburdened.
Malawi has started a process of formulating a law that will protect people from deliberate and malicious infection of HIV, a senior government official disclosed on Friday.
``This creates a huge challenge in terms of infection control, especially in settings where a high numbers of HIV-positive individuals are converging,'' such as hospitals, Weyer said.
Shawa said the Malawian government had set up a special law commission that would come up with an HIV/AIDS law after consulting the whole country.
Previous studies have shown that herpes infections can triple a person's chance of acquiring HIV and can make HIV-positive individuals more infectious.
"Cataract surgeries have been carried out extremely efficiently to prevent blindness worldwide," said Dr. Richard Hayes, an AIDS expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
"The government is just responding to the needs of the people who have been calling for such a law for a very long time," Mary Shawa, principal secretary for HIV/AIDS and nutrition in the president's office told Xinhua.
"The body cannot choose ... to get help from one agency or another if it has more than one disease," Gawanas said.
Researchers of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, had the findings after having carried out a small trial in Africa, New Scientist reported Thursday on its website.
However, scientists generally have found that the more virus someone has, the greater the risk of transmission.
While circumcision may offer new hope, it is not a cure for the epidemic.
But they caution solid evidence is not justification for mass circumcisions.
Scientists theorize that women would benefit indirectly from lower HIV prevalence in men, and a study is currently ongoing in Uganda to determine this.
South Africa's main anti-AIDS lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said the halting of microbicide trials was a "setback".
Another mooted reason is that the foreskin is rich in so-called Langerhans cells whose surface configuration makes it easy for the AIDS virus to latch on to them.
Mayaud has received research support from Glaxo.
Malawi, like other southern African countries, has seen its life expectancy at birth drop from about 60 in the early 1990s to below 35 presently due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
"The termination of the Ushercell trials is a setback for microbicide research," the TAC said in a statement.
In the first study of HIV dementia on the African continent using rigorous neurological and neuropsychological tests, 31 percent of a small but presumably representative group of HIV-positive patients in Uganda were found to have HIV dementia, according to Ned Sacktor, M.D., a Johns Hopkins neurologist and senior author of a multi-institutional study that will be published Jan. 29 in Neurology.
In addition, the operation has to be conducted in sterile conditions by trained personnel, and this will require resources for awareness campaigns and set up medical facilities.
Doctors have seen sporadic cases for decades, but the XDR form gained attention after the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal province.
Resistance testing is widespread in the U.S., but Fenton said the South African cases are a ``wake-up call'' for strengthening TB surveillance and prevention.
The announcement of the number infections comes a day after Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang ordered an investigation into the microbicide clinical trials in the eastern KwaZulu Natal province.
Tshabalala-Msimang said a thorough investigation was needed to establish if participants in the trial process had been properly informed about the risks.
The panel echoed a need for general health services that some expressed would improve treatment and prevention of the disease.
The disease can kill with surprising speed, particularly among HIV patients, whose immune systems are weakened.
In some places, the cataract surgeries are performed by trained paramedics.
"You cannot focus on one issue at the exclusion of others."
"If, heaven forbid, we didn't have treatments for HIV, this would be something we would use.
Doctors have been looking for novel ways to treat and prevent HIV infection, particularly in poor countries where few can afford modern AIDS drugs and the stigma keeps many from taking them.
Experts say the breakthrough is a significant one on par with the identification of the virus and the use of lifesaving combination drug therapy.
These microscopic cuts make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter the man's bloodstream.
"It is unlikely that a succesful microbicide will be found in the next few years and it is possible that other ongoing microbicide trials will fail.
The study did not look at whether the drug, sold as Valtrex by GlaxoSmithKline PLC, actually reduces transmission of the AIDS virus.
"It does open some potential avenues to slowing down the HIV epidemic," said Dr. Lawrence Corey, a leading herpes researcher at the University of Washington who had no role in the study but has received research grants from Glaxo.
"Nevertheless, science advances by learning from failures and ethical trials of the most promising microbicides should continue because the development of a successful microbicide will likely prevent many HIV infections and save many lives."
The studies were testing Ushercell, a gel containing cellulose sulfate, a cotton-based compound developed by Polydex Pharmaceuticals, based in Toronto.
"I cannot think of any biological basis for these findings, and I hope that further analysis of all of the data may shed further light on this important question," said a statement by USAID's research chief, Jeff Spieler.
Dementia not only disrupts jobs and adds to the cost of care, but also interferes with a patient's ability to adhere to a regular course of antiretroviral medication, thus increasing the risk of drug resistance.
That product is seaweed-based, and no safety problems have been seen in three preliminary evaluations on 6,000 women in South Africa, said council spokeswoman Melissa May.
However, those trials were deemed so definitive that the tests were halted early.
But Friday's publication in the peer-assessed Lancet of the Kenya and Uganda research is the medical community's de-facto validation of the findings, and enshrines circumcision's place in the war against AIDS.
Most importantly, reduction of risk is not the same as elimination of risk, which means that circumcised men should still be encouraged to wear a condom.
Another study of a different microbicide, Carraguard, developed by the New York-based Population Council, is due to wrap up in March and to report results later this year.
Researchers reported last year that median survival time for patients in one study was 25 days following their diagnosis.
Ushercell appeared safe and promising in 11 previous studies, mostly done in the United States.
XDR tuberculosis is resistant to many drugs, although it can be treated with four antibiotics if caught early enough.
Circumcision requires much more planning than, for example, an immunization campaign.
Fortunately, we have much better therapies to treat HIV," said Dr. Michael Saag, director of the AIDS Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
"We have proof of a permanent intervention that can reduce the risk of HIV infection in men, which is positive news about prevention after past and current disappointments," said a commentary by Marie-Louise Newell and Till Barnighausen of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Harvard School of Public Health.
"It's a tricky one, but it's something we're going to have to move on," said Dr. Catherine Hankins, a scientific adviser at UNAIDS.
Swaziland, for instance, recently experimented with a series of "Circumcision Saturdays," where existing health care facilities, normally closed on weekends, were opened by local doctors to circumcise approximately 40 men a day on certain Saturdays.
A focus on treatment programs is drawing attention away from prevention strategies and general health care services could correct the balance, Osotimehin said.
In some cultures, circumcision is considered a rite of passage to adulthood and a symbol of in others, it is considered an emasculation.
Several African countries have already met with U.N. agencies to explore new strategies for increasing circumcision services.
Treatment can even restore completely normal cognitive function to some of those affected.
Seventy-eight were HIV-positive patients recruited from the Infectious Disease Clinic in Mulago Hospital, Makerere University, and 100 were HIV-negative individuals recruited from the AIDs Information Center who were used to obtain normative data for the cognitive tests.
Bience Gawanas, the AU's commissioner for social affairs, joined members of African-based HIV/AIDS organizations, U.N. delegates and staff on Friday for an informal briefing on HIV/AIDS.
It is unknown whether circumcision would be equally effective in concentrated AIDS epidemics, as in Asia and eastern Europe, where AIDS primarily strikes gay men and drug users.
But Newell and Barnighausen join other experts in saying that the urge to swiftly implement circumcision should be leavened with caution.
"The U.N. system approach says look at AIDS and TB, then look at something else," she said.
"Treating people with antiretrovirals is completely unsustainable unless we can turn off the tap of infection," said Hayes.
Providing circumcisions across Africa would not be the first time surgical procedures have been adopted by public health campaigns.
``With foreign travel and migration to the U.S., we have to be very much aware of emerging threats of XDR TB.''
The circumcision data gives prevention, rather than treatment, renewed emphasis.
Together with the United Nations AIDS agency, WHO is convening a meeting in Switzerland in early March to evaluate the circumcision data, and to decide on the next steps in slowing the AIDS pandemic.
The South African findings were presented at the opening here of the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Diseases.
In diagnosing HIV dementia, researchers looked at medical history and the results of a series of comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological tests and functional assessments.
"There is no one size fits all solution for AIDS."
"The emerging truth is that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV," The Lancet said in an editorial.
"I have asked a thorough investigation into this matter to establish whether the study followed all protocols approved by the Medicine Control Council," she said after a meeting with local scientists.
