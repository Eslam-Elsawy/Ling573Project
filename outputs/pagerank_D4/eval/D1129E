A high blood level of vitamin D could help reduce the risk of breast cancer by half and of colorectal cancer by two-thirds, the studies found.
As with the breast cancer study, the dose-response data on a total of 1,448 individuals were put into order by serum 25(OH)D level and then divided into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels to the highest.
The colorectal cancer research, published online in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, analyzed five studies on 1,448 individuals that explored the association of blood levels of vitamin D with colon cancer risk.
"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun."
"If future studies continue to show reductions in breast cancer risk associated with sun exposure, increasing vitamin D intake from diet and supplements may be the safest solution to achieve adequate levels of vitamin D," said Gary Schwartz, a co-researcher from Wake Forest University.
The breast cancer study, published online in the current issue of the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, found that individuals with the highest blood levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, had the lowest risk of breast cancer.
The colorectal cancer study, published online February 6 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, is a meta-analysis of five studies that explored the association of blood levels of 25( OH)D with risk of colon cancer.
The data revealed an inverse association of serum vitamin D with risk of colorectal and breast cancer.
He supports raising the recommended amount of the vitamin and said 1,000 daily units of vitamin D3 would now be reasonable for most people.
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight.
A U.S. research team has found that increased exposure to sunlight  which increases levels of vitamin D in the body  may decrease the risk of advanced breast cancer, according to a study reported Friday in the latest issue of American Journal of Epidemiology.
For example, people with a 25(OH)D blood level of 33 nanograms per milliliter or higher were 50 percent less likely to have developed colorectal cancer than were those with a level of 12 ng/ml or lower.
"The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased," said study co- author Cedric Garland, Dr.P.H.
"The serum level associated with a 50 percent reduction in risk could be maintained by taking 2,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily plus, when the weather permits, spending 10 to 15 minutes a day in the sun," he said.
In a story about a study suggesting vitamin D lowers cancer risk in older women, The Associated Press reported that an American Cancer Society doctor favors keeping current vitamin D guidelines of 200 to 600 international units daily.
"We believe that sunlight helps to reduce women's risk of breast cancer because the body manufactures the active form of vitamin D from exposure to sunlight," said Esther John, lead researcher on the study from the Northern California Cancer Center.
A number of 600,000 cases a year of breast and colorectal cancer could be prevented each year if vitamin D3 levels met the target proposed by researchers, said the study by researchers at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
"The data were very clear, showing that individuals in the group with the lowest blood levels had the highest rates of breast cancer, and the breast cancer rates dropped as the blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased," said study co- author Cedric Garland.
The study estimated that taking 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D supplements daily would create a blood level of at least 33 ng/ml.
The researchers from the Northern California Cancer Center, the University of Southern California, and Wake Forest University found that women with high sun exposure had half the risk of developing advanced breast cancer, which is cancer that has spread beyond the breast, compared to women with low sun exposure.
During that time, those whose blood registered the highest levels of vitamin D were the least likely to develop colorectal cancer.
For the breast cancer study, published online in the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, researchers analyzed data from two earlier studies on the response to vitamin D doses among 1,760 people.
Two new vitamin D studies have revealed new prescriptions for possibly preventing up to half of the cases of breast cancer and two-thirds of the cases of colorectal cancer in the United States.
Milk is not a natural source of the vitamin, but most dairies fortify milk with it.
The new research strengthens the case made by some specialists that vitamin D may be a powerful cancer preventive and most people should get more of it.
Raising vitamin D levels by taking supplements and absorbing a little bit of sunshine each day may help prevent colorectal and breast cancers, said two studies published Tuesday.
All of the studies involved blood collected and tested for 25 (OH)D levels from healthy volunteer donors who were then followed for up to 25 years for development of colorectal cancer.
"Through this meta-analysis we found that raising the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 34 ng/ml would reduce the incidence rates of colorectal cancer by half," said co-author Edward D. Gorham, Ph.D.
The society recommended that adults living in Canada should consider taking 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D supplements a day during the fall and winter.
The researchers highlighted the importance of limiting sun exposure to avoid skin cancer risks.
A study published Thursday in the "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition" showed a 60 to 77 percent drop in cancer rates among postmenopausal women who took vitamin D combined with calcium, compared with a placebo.
The incidence rate of colorectal cancer could be reduced by half with a serum level 34 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), the study found.
The study combined data from surveys of serum vitamin D levels during winter from 15 countries.
Skin color is an important factor that determines how much vitamin D is produced in the body after sun exposure.
Vitamin D3 is available through diet, supplements and exposure of the skin to sunlight, or ultraviolet B (UVB).
This study, published Friday in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, is the first time that researchers significantly boosted  and measured  blood levels of vitamin D and then followed identical groups of patients from start to finish.
This would be best achieved with a combination of diet, supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun," said study co-author Edward Gorham.
The research team gave 1,000 daily international units of vitamin D, more than current guidelines calling for 200 to 600 units depending on a person's age.
These new findings are consistent with previous research by John and colleagues that had shown that women who reported frequent sun exposure had a lower risk of developing breast cancer than women with infrequent sun exposure.
"It is possible that these effects were observed only among light- skinned women because sun exposure produces less vitamin D among women with naturally darker pigmentation."
Women should not try to reduce their risk of breast cancer by sunbathing because of the risks of sun-induced skin cancer, they said.
Most multivitamin supplements contain 400 IU of vitamin D. So if you don't drink milk or get enough from your favorite foods, consider taking a daily multivitamin.
And the difference was seen only in women with advanced disease, suggesting that vitamin D may be important in slowing the growth of breast cancer cells.
"For the first time, we are saying that 600,000 cases of breast and colorectal cancer could be prevented each year worldwide, including nearly 150,000 in the United States alone," said Cedric F.Garland, a cancer prevention specialist at UCSD.
The researchers divided the 1,760 records of individuals into five equal groups, from the lowest blood levels of 25(OH)D (less than 13 nanograms per milliliter, or 13 ng/ml) to the highest ( approximately 52 ng/ml).
This would be best achieved with a combination of diet, supplements and 10 to 15 minutes per day in the sun," he added.
These findings were observed only for women with naturally light skin color.
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body because sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.
The two studies were conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and other colleagues.
"We project a two-thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng/ml, which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3.
"We project a two-thirds reduction in incidence with serum levels of 46ng/ml, which corresponds to a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3.
That shows a 60 percent lower cancer risk over four years in the group taking both supplements, compared to patients taking placebos.
Only 13 women, or 3 percent, developed cancer over four years of calcium and vitamin D supplements.
The authors were intrigued by the observation that death from many diseases, including cancer, heart disease and diabetes, appears to increase with increasing latitude.
Dark-skinned individuals produce up to 10 times less vitamin D than light- skinned individuals for the same amount of time spent in the sun.
The fact that this difference occurred only in light skin color group suggests that the effect was due to differences in vitamin D production, said the researchers.
While numbers were limited, these women developed a broad range of cancers, including disease of the breast, colon, lungs and blood.
Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?
The role of vitamin D in chronic disease is unclear, but the vitamin is needed for strong bones and to regulate cell growth.
The study reported a possible association between the vitamin and cancer, not a cause-and-effect relationship.
On the other hand, Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society favors keeping the current recommendation of 200 to 600 IUs for now.
"Vitamin D deficiency is very common," particularly in areas hard hit by winter, says Robert Busch, an endocrinologist here.
Send your questions to her c/o The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Eighth Floor, 72 Marietta St.
A tablespoon of cod-liver oil contains more than 1,300 IUs.
Scientists are also assessing the vitamin's role in boosting the immune system and protecting against some cancers.
She started taking vitamin D supplements, which are just a few dollars for a bottle of 100, and noticed she no longer felt as stiff in her joints.
"I'm thinking if that's me, because I don't have a horrible diet, I can't imagine what the general population's is," Carr says.
Carr was surprised when her results came back showing her levels were on the low end of normal.
That is why, despite its modest size, the research was generating excitement.
In December, after reading a little more about the vitamin, Carr asked her doctor to include a vitamin D analysis with her routine blood work.
The researchers at Creighton University in Omaha focused on 1,179 seemingly healthy women with an average age of 67.

And when the first-year cancers were excluded  the ones mostly likely present before the study began  the findings were stronger still: a 77 percent lower risk for the combo group.
Building hope for one pill to prevent many cancers, vitamin D cut the risk of several types of cancer by 60 percent overall for older women in the most rigorous study yet.
The data also included whether or not the individual had developed cancer.
Adequate intake of vitamin D may help prevent cancer, according to a new study.
One cup of most commercially available milk contains 100 International Units of vitamin D or about 25 percent of daily needs for young adults.
The effect of Vitamin D3 is more evident in countries north of the equator.
Some foods carry the vitamin, like salmon, tuna and fortified milk, but diet accounts for little of the vitamin circulating in the body.
The researchers stressed that sunlight is not the only source of vitamin D, which can be obtained from multivitamins, fatty fish and fortified foods such as milk, certain cereals and fruit juices.
With dummy pills, cancer appeared in 20 women, or 7 percent.
With calcium alone, 17 women, or 4 percent, got cancer.
Vitamin D, called the "sunshine vitamin" because the body makes its own after absorbing the sun's rays, is key to the absorption of calcium.
The work was conducted by a core team of cancer prevention specialists at the Moores Cancer Center at University of California, San Diego, and colleagues from both coasts.
The skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight's ultraviolet rays.
Overexposure to the sun can cause skin cancer.
That suggests calcium alone may have done little in this experiment, the researchers said.
When we don't get enough, our bodies draw calcium out of our bones to compensate, reducing bone density and increasing fracture risk, Busch says.
The farther from the equator, the less we are exposed to ultraviolet light.
It is the first such study to look at satellite measurements of sunshine and cloud cover in countries where actual blood serum levels of vitamin D3 had also been determined.
"The findings ... are a breakthrough of great medical and public health importance," declared Cedric Garland, a prominent vitamin D researcher at the University of California-San Diego.
CAVEATS All participants in the studies were whether the findings apply to others is unclear.
The researchers intended to check mainly for the effects of calcium on bone health.
People who live farther from the equator seem to have higher death rates.
"It's a very small study," said Dr. Edward Giovannucci, who researches nutrition and cancer at the Harvard School of Public Health.
They said a fair-skinned white person could get an adequate dose of vitamin D by spending 10 to 15 minutes in the noontime sun on a clear day with 50 percent of skin area exposed to the sun, while darker skinned people may need to stay as long as 25 minutes under the sun to achieve a similiar benefit.
THIS STUDY combined and analyzed data from five studies, involving 1,448 healthy people whose blood was tested for the presence of the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, the main form of vitamin D in the circulatory system.
The data were then applied to 177 countries to estimate the average serum level of a vitamin D metabolite of people living there.
A recent paper in the Archives of Internal Medicine concluded that vitamin D intake is associated with lower death rates from a variety of causes.
"We're recommending 1,000 IUs daily because the current evidence suggests this amount will help reduce cancer risk with the least potential for harm," said Heather Logan, the society's director of cancer control policy.
This is of particular concern among post-menopausal women and those with a high risk of osteoporosis.
Calcium-fortified orange juice often contains vitamin D (Tropicana with calcium and vitamin D provides as much calcium and vitamin D in 8 ounces as in one glass of milk), but Tropicana regular orange juice doesn't contain the vitamin.
Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. It is a fat-soluble vitamin found in fatty fish, like salmon, as well as liver and eggs.
Salmon (360 IUs for 3.5 ounces), sardines (250 IUs for 13/4 ounces) and fortified milk (about 100 IUs per serving) are also good sources.
Typically, dietitians say the best source of vitamins is through the foods we eat, rather than supplements.
It may not be the winter blahs, but a lack of vitamin D brought about by, well, winter.
WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BY THESE FINDINGS?
But the lower cancer risk stood out.
- More studies are indicating that vitamin D is a "hot" nutrient - and not just because it is called the "sunshine" vitamin.
In the paper, the researchers also underscored the importance of limiting sun exposure such that the skin does not change color (tan) or burn.
Cause of the disease is unknown, but contributing factors appear to include family history, smoking and diet.
Joan Lappe, the study's lead researcher, said it "just adds to the great bunch of evidence that we need to have better vitamin D nutrition."
It has long been known that blood levels of vitamin D decrease as we age (by age 70, we make about half of what we did at age 20).
Adults should get a blood test to make sure they are getting enough vitamin D.
Earlier research has shown that vitamin D helps regulate cell growth, a fundamental biological process that goes haywire in cancer.
THE QUESTION Colorectal cancer seems to occur more often among those who live in sunshine-deprived areas, leading some people to theorize that the lack of vitamin D (which sun helps the body absorb) may play a role in the disease.
The Institute of Medicine has set 2,000 IU as an upper limit, so don't take more than this in supplement form.
The paper, which looks at the dose-response relationship between vitamin D and cancer, will be published in the August edition of the journal Nutrition Reviews.
The participants' health was monitored for up to 25 years.
It was designed mainly to monitor how calcium and vitamin D improve bone health, and the number of cancer cases overall was small, showing up in just 50 patients.
Because of deficiency concerns, the current recommendations for vitamin D  200 international units for people up to age 400 IUs for those 51 to and 600 IUs for those older  may be changing, says Judy Carr, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator.
While the calcium-only group lowered its four-year cancer risk by 47 percent compared to the untreated group, it did no better when early cancers were excluded.
You might be surprised that another popular dairy food, yogurt, may not contain any vitamin D. For example, Yoplait yogurt has 80 IU of vitamin D in a 6-ounce container, but Dannon fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt has none.
Nearly all other work has compared disparate groups of patients.
The women were divided into three groups: 446 got calcium and vitamin D3 supplements, a similar number got calcium alone, and 288 took dummy pills.
A lack of the vitamin might affect the growth of cancer cells and the growth of artery-clogging plaque that leads to heart attack and stroke.
Multivitamins usually carry a much weaker variant known as D2, but D3 is available in stand-alone dietary supplements.
If we make less as we age and if slathering on sunblock reduces our ability to make the vitamin, where can we get it?
Experts reviewing the study focused on vitamin D as the powerful agent in the combo group, but it can't be ruled out that calcium might somehow amplify the effect of vitamin D.
More study is needed to determine if the effects in this study hold true for large groups of people and men as well as women.
Adults at higher risk of having vitamin D deficiency, including older people, those with darker skin, not going outside often or wearing clothing that covers most skin, should consider taking the 1,000 IU supplement year round, the society said in a statement.
This study used that same form of the vitamin, known as D3 or cholecalciferol.
Canada's Cancer Society on Thursday urged people to increase vitamin D intake, citing growing evidence of the supplement reducing cancer risks.
And he cautioned that more than 2,000 units is viewed in the guidelines as potentially dangerous.
And it's reasonable, Busch advises, for someone with insufficient levels of vitamin D to take up to 1,000 IUs daily without any adverse side effects.
Anyone concerned about colorectal cancer.
He suggests post-menopausal women, those with unexplained muscle weakness and anyone else who may suspect low vitamin D levels ask their doctors for a "25-hydroxy vitamin D" screening.
Now, when she does nutritional consultations with patients who are complaining of joint pain or muscle weakness, she asks if their doctor has checked their vitamin D levels.
Still, people should consult their doctors before boosting their vitamin dosage, several experts also warned.
In either case, the study takes an important step in extending several decades of research that began with observations that cancer rates among similar groups of people were lower in southern latitudes than in northern ones.
Their interest in cancer risk was secondary.
But Carr says the best food sources of vitamin D aren't necessarily the foods we love.
Most other supplements have tended to target specific types of disease in early testing, like selenium or vitamin E for prostate cancer.
Light from the sun converts a chemical in our skin into vitamin D, and further conversions in the liver and kidney make the most active form of the vitamin: vitamin D3.
"No other method to prevent cancer has been identified that has such a powerful impact."
Dr. Michael Holick, of Boston University Medical Center, who sat on the professional panel that issued the 1997 guidelines for vitamin D, said this study shows that enough vitamin D "markedly reduces the risk of developing the most serious deadly cancers."
More than 90 percent of diagnoses occur after age 50.
Dr. Michael Thun now says he misunderstood a reporter's question and holds no position on whether those amounts should be changed.
Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician.
She'll answer nutrition questions of general interest.
While the most reliable yet, the study does have drawbacks.
Scientists reasoned that had to do with more direct sunlight in southern regions.
Even breast milk is vitamin-D deficient, so breast-fed infants need vitamin D supplements.
Vitamin D content does not always show up on the nutrition facts panel, so be a label reader to find out if your favorite food contains this important vitamin.
In the summer, go without sunscreen for no more than 15 minutes a few times a week, and your body can make sufficient amounts of vitamin D without putting you at greater risk for skin cancer, Busch says.
Experts remain split, though, on how much to take.
More vitamin D might mean less risk.
Nonetheless, conclusive evidence about a treatment's effectiveness is rarely found in a single study.
The research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals.
Chris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., is a professor of nutrition in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Georgia State University.
He also said he thinks it's too early to recommend using vitamin D to prevent cancer.
US health authorities have not established a recommended daily allowance for the vitamin due to insufficient scientific evidence.
