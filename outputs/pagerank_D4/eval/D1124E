Thirteen people were killed in the November explosion when the underground pipeline in East Java ruptured following subsidence around a nearby gas well that has been spewing mud since May 2006, inundating villages and forcing more than 13,000 people to flee their homes.
A leading Indonesian environmental group has filed a suit against President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and an energy firm on mud flow that has damaged environment and displaced more than 10,000 people in Java Island, the group's chairman said here on Tuesday.
A key railway line threatened by a massive "mud volcano" which has forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Indonesian island of Java will be relocated, officials said Tuesday.
It erupted from a gas well near Surabaya, East Java, that was operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. As many as 13,000 people have fled their homes.
A gas well near Surabaya in East Java has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, factories and fields and forcing more than 15,000 people to flee their homes.
An Indonesian minister claimed Wednesday that a vast "mud volcano" which has inundated villages on the island of Java was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company controlled by his family.
An Indonesian minister, Aburizal Bakrie, claimed last month the flow was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities of a company, Lapindo Brantas Inc, which belongs to a group controlled by his family.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono last month ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420.7 million dollars) in compensation and costs related to the mud flow.

A gas well operated by Lapindo Brantas Inc. has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages and forcing some 13,000 people to flee their homes.
A mud volcano that has erupted in Indonesia, forcing the evacuation of thousands of villagers, was most probably caused by drilling for gas, according to the first published scientific study into the phenomenon.
According to most experts, Lapindo Brantas Inc., owned by the Bakrie Group controlled by the minister's family, made a serious technical error in its exploratory drilling by not taking measures to prevent the possible escape of liquid or gas under pressure.

Officials said the concrete balls would be lowered by crane into the main source of the mud spill near Surabaya, in East Java.
The attempt to plug the "mud volcano" involves dropping hundreds of concrete balls chained together in groups into the well, which is operated by PT Lapindo Brantas.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered Lapindo to pay 3.8 trillion rupiah (420 million dollars) in compensation and costs.
In its suit, the group demanded the president order Lapindo Brantas Inc., and its partners to allocate fund and resources to compensate victims and restore the environment.
Hundreds of concrete balls will be dropped into a "mud volcano" on Wednesday, although experts warned it is unlikely to stop a massive mud flow which has swallowed villages and left 15,000 people homeless.
A gas well near Surabaya, operated by PT Lapindo Brantas, has spewed steaming mud since May last year, submerging villages, factories and fields.
But Lapindo only agreed to pay 276 millions U.S. dollars per square meter for inundated land and damaged buildings, and about 12 U.S. dollars for a square meter of rice fields.
Lapindo and five related companies, President Yudhoyono, the energy and environment ministers and local officials were named as defendants, he said.

Last week, Indonesia's coordinating minister for social welfare, Aburizal Bakrie, whose family firm controls Lapindo Brantas, said the volcano was a "natural disaster" unrelated to the drilling activities.
Persada belongs to the Bakrie Group, controlled by the family of Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for People Welfare and Poverty Alleviation, Aburizal Bakrie.
He said the only option was to quickly channel the mud to the sea before it dried out.
An Indonesian airline offering short flights to avoid a "mud volcano" that has inundated villages on the island of Java was Thursday forced to suspend its maiden flight due to technical problems, a report said.
The accident of oil drilling in May last year caused hot mud pouring into surrounding area and inundated entire villages in Siduarjo in East Java, the second biggest city in Indonesia.
"Just as is most probably the case with Lusi, the Brunei event was caused by drilling and it took an international oil company almost 30 years and 20 relief wells and monitoring before the eruption stopped," he added.
"We have started the construction of 1.6 kilometres of the three-kilometre pipe but we cannot finish it," he told the official Antara news agency.
Experts have been working to channel the mud into the nearby sea.
Bakrie also said the mud, which has forced 13,000 people to flee and continues to spread, was not toxic and could be dumped in the sea without concern.
The volcano, known locally as "Lusi," has been spewing steaming mud since May 29 last year, submerging four villages, fields and factories.
However several geologists, including Edi Sunardi from the University of Pajajaran, have said the scheme will likely fail.
Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie has said little about the environmental disaster and his explanation at a Jakarta Foreign Correspondents' Club lunch was questioned by journalists and diplomats.
The research is conducted by a team led by Richard Davies, a professor at the University of Durham's Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems in northeastern England.
State railway operator PT Kereta Api said it lacked the 450 billion rupiah (50 million dollars) required to relocate the 18-kilometre track and would ask the government team for financial help, detikcom news portal reported.
The latest effort was originally planned for two weeks ago, but was delayed for technical reasons.
The government will shift the track, which currently runs very close to the mud volcano zone, four kilometres (more than two miles) from its present location.
It appears in the February issue of GSA Today, a peer-assessed journal of the Geological Society of America (GSA).
Indonesia sits on the so-called "Pacific Ring of Fire", where continental plates meet and cause frequent volcanic and seismic activity.
Indonesian airlines have come under closer scrutiny following the disappearance of an Adam Air plane carrying 102 people on New Year's Day.
The service was designed to allow passengers travelling between the two cities to avoid the inundated Sidoarjo district, which lies between them.
By breaking through a layer containing hydrogen sulphide, the drilling allowed hot mud to rise and escape.
Novrianto has said the team planned to gradually drop about 375 chains of linked balls of differing sizes, each chain weighing between 400 and 500 kilograms (880 to 1,100 pounds).
The team hopes to slow down the outflow by between 50 and 70 percent.
"We hope the balls can slow down the flow by between 50 and 70 percent," said Novrianto.
Recent downpours have also affected parts of the line, forcing trains to slow down to avoid accidents.
"We are quite used to ash rains as we live in such close proximity with Mount Semeru," he said.
Susanto said the ash rain that had coated everything in the town was not a source of concern for local residents.
Pertamina spokesman Toharso said residents in the district had objected to construction of a new three-kilometre (two-mile) pipeline parallel to the old one as compensation for the land had not been agreed.
But Rudi Novrianto, spokesman for the government team handling the crisis, said construction to relocate the line "will not start until next year."
Indonesian authorities Wednesday postponed the start of an attempt to slow a massive mudflow which has swallowed villages by plugging the crater with chains of concrete balls.
"It does not kill the fish," he said.
In addition, the ecosystem also destroyed as the government decided to channel the hot mud to the sea.
"It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake," he said, referring to a May 27 temblor near the ancient city of Yogyakarta that killed around 6,000 people.
"The hot mud flow has damaged ecosystem and hundreds of hectares of agricultural land.
The eruption "appears to have been triggered by drilling of overpressured porous and permeable limestones at depth of around 2,830 metres (7,735 feet) below the surface," says the study, conducted by British experts and published in a US journal.
Lapindo and Energi Mega Persada companies, which indirectly control the operation, have been in dispute on whether the mud flow was caused by the drilling and whether Lapindo alone should shoulder the cost.
"We are still not ready with all the necessary preparations and now it looks like the operation will only be possible on Friday at the earliest," Rudi Novrianto, spokesman for the government team handling the crisis, told AFP.
"We are now doing the technical design," he told AFP.
Indonesia's state-owned gas company Pertamina has halted construction of a gas pipeline replacing one which burst in a deadly explosion because compensation has not been agreed, a report said Friday.
It concludes that the quake was not to blame, mainly because two days elapsed before mud volcano erupted, and no other mud volcanoes occurred in the region after the temblor.
"It is not because of the Lapindo drill case but it is because of the quake," he said, referring to the May 27 quake near the ancient city of Yogyakarta which killed around 6,000 people.
The advancing sea of mud has blocked a nearby main road and is now threatening to swamp a key railway, which is to be rerouted away from the danger zone.

The advancing sea of mud is now threatening to swamp the railway connecting Indonesia's second largest city Surabaya with Malang and Banyuwangi.
Experts have failed to curb or channel the mud to the sea.
The land trip used to take about two hours but now takes five due to the mud flow, which has damaged a major toll road and railway tracks.
Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar has said it could take years before the mud stops flowing.
Chairman Chalid Muhammad said the Wahana Lingkungan Hidup ( Walhi) filed a law suit on the South Jakarta court on Monday, naming the operator of the drilling Lapindo Brantas Corp., its partners, Indonesian President Susilo and other officials as defendants.
The British experts analysed satellite images of the area to make their study.
"We are looking at a plane, and you cannot plug such a plane with concrete balls," Sunardi said, adding that the pressure may even push the balls back to the surface.
"Preparations are just about done," Rudi Novrianto, spokesman for the government team handling the crisis, told AFP Tuesday.
Mount Semeru in Indonesia's densely-populated East Java province spewed ash at the weekend, coating a nearby town, but the volcano does not pose any danger to residents, officials said Monday.
The Indonesian government has been criticized for not doing enough to handle the problem.
Pertamina also has to wait for construction of an 800-metre long dyke to protect the pipeline, which was expected to be completed in February.
Antara news agency reported 2,000 of the high-density concrete balls had been ordered from the Bandung Institute of Technology, after its physics experts came up with the plan to stem the mudflow.
Sriwijaya Air had to postpone to January 29 the launch of its route between the cities of Malang and Surabaya in East Java, the official Antara news agency said.
A change in the route would shorten the pipe but bring it closer to the danger zone around the "mud volcano," he said.
In addition, 13 people died after an explosion in November when an underground gas pipeline burst following subsidence that was blamed on the mud leak.

Various efforts have been made to stop the flow and divert the spewing mud into a nearby river, none of which has been successful.
He said the crane which will lift the balls and drop them into the crater was not yet in place.
The officials were named for failing to quickly contain the mud spill.
"They assume that the flow comes from a hole, but we're looking at a plane, and you cannot plug such a plane with concrete balls," said Sunardi, explaining that the strong pressure may even push the balls back up to the surface.
Winds had carried the ash from the 3,676-metre (12,277-foot) Mount Semeru to the town of Lumajang, some 35 kilometers (22 miles) away.
"Residents reject the route we are using because the land settlements have not been agreed," said Toharso.
In the meantime, Novrianto said there was no other option but to use the current track.
"Given the obstructed land transportation between Surabaya and Malang due to the incessant mud flow, we came up with the idea of introducing a short flight as an alternative to land transportation," Purnadi said.
An area of at least 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) around the volcano will be uninhabitable for years, and over 11,000 people will be permanently displaced, it says.
United Nations experts however predicted in a report that the sudden influx of mud in the sea would destroy the marine ecosystem.
"We are taking them to court because the mud outflow caused by Lapindo has thoroughly damaged the environment in Sidoarjo," said Chalid Muhammad, the chairman of Walhi, the country's leading environment watchdog.
Our research brings us to the conclusion that the incident was most probably the result of drilling."
"It is standard industry procedure that this kind of drilling requires the use of steel casing to support the borehole, to protect against the pressure of fluids such as water, oil or gas," Davies said in a press release.
"They (the mud) are moving back from the (current) place to their original place," Barie said.
"In the case of Lusi, a pressured limestone rock containing water  a water aquifer  was drilled while the lower part of the borehole was exposed and not protected by casing.
"As a result, rocks fractured and a mix of mud and water worked its way to the surface.
It inundated villages and internally displaced residents," he told Xinhua.
A system of dykes is holding back the steaming mud, which is bubbling up at a rate of up to 150,000 cubic metres (5.25 million cubic feet) a day.
The concrete balls, devised by experts at the state-run Bandung Institute of Technology, are expected to still allow the mud to flow out, but at a much reduced volume.
Various ideas on how to stop the flow and divert the mud into a nearby river have been tried, but none were successful.
"The suspension is simply due to technical problem because the Air Transportation Directorate General conducted an unscheduled inspection in relation with air-worthiness," the airline's Malang district manager M. Yusri said.
"The mud is the sea mud," he said, adding it was laid down at a time in geological history when the area was covered by the sea.
But Bakrie claimed nothing could have prevented the disaster, quoting "international and national experts," and instead blamed it on an earthquake hundreds of kilometres from the site of the mud flow.
Davies said the case in Indonesia was similar to a blowout that happened offshore of Brunei in 1979.
They say that seepage of mud and water are usually a preventable hazard when exploring for oil and gas.
Such pressures, coupled to the local geology, suggest the flow "will continue for many months and possibly years to come," it warns.
"The ash rain fell on Saturday and Sunday but luckily we also have had heavy rains, so the ash was quickly cleaned from the surface," said Edi Susanto, an official from the Lumajang district spokesman's office.
It adds that the volcano has been disgorging between 7,000 and 150,000 cubic metres (245,000 and 5.25 million cubic feet) of mud every day.
But this scenario is ruled out by the study.
"It will not endanger the shrimp industry."
"The settlement of the hot mud has never touched the environmental aspects and pointed who are responsible to prevent the pouring of the mud," said Muhammad.
Muhammad said hundreds of hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, scores of factories have been closed and over 9,000 workers lost their jobs,
In the coming months, sag-like subsidence several kilometers (miles) wide will occur, and around the main vent there is likely to be "more dramatic collapse," forming a crater, it adds.
However geologist Edi Sunardi, from the University of Pajajaran, said "the effort is useless.
