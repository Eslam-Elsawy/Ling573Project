Polar bears are not the only species threatened by global warming.
But polar bears are not the first species (nor will they likely be the last) for which we have sought the protections of the Endangered Species Act because of global warming.
In December, the Bush administration, facing a deadline under a suit by environmental groups, proposed listing polar bears throughout their range as threatened under the Endangered Species Act because the warming climate is causing a summertime retreat of sea ice that the bears use as for seal hunting.
In response, the administration is proposing to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.
The scientists "will not be speaking on or responding to these issues" of climate change, polar bears and sea ice, the memos say.
Last December, Kempthorne proposed designating polar bears as a "threatened" species deserving of federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, because of melting Arctic sea ice from global warming.
If the polar bear were listed as a threatened species, all federal agencies would have to ensure that anything they authorize that might affect polar bears will not jeopardize their survival or the sea ice where they live.
The federal government has proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species, and the wildlife agency is receiving public comment on the proposal.
The study is likely to give ammunition to conservation groups that want polar bears to be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Department of Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in December proposed listing polar bears as a "threatened" species instead.
The Fish and Wildlife Service must study how much sea ice has been lost, how fast it is melting and how that affects polar bears before Kempthorne makes a final decision by the end of the year.
In December, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne proposed listing polar bears as a threatened species.
On Dec. 27, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced a proposal to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act because of the loss of its sea ice habitat from global warming.
The Bush administration will examine whether a growing number of species, including polar bears affected by thinning sea ice, are at risk from global warming and need federal protection, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said Friday.
Fish and Wildlife Service but was made public this week.
Fish and Wildlife Service appear to require government biologists or other employees traveling in countries around the Arctic not to discuss climate change, polar bears or sea ice if they are not designated to do so.
Before any trip, such a memo must be sent to the administrator of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington.
The corals were listed as threatened species in May, but with far less fanfare than the polar bear and without an explicit recognition of global warming as a cause of their decline.
What is the cause of the ice melting?
The agency has taken steps to evaluate whether the polar bear should be listed and has significant questions about scientific studies, including those dealing with when sea ice will melt and the effects on the bear, he said.
More pregnant polar bears in Alaska are digging snow dens on land instead of sea ice, and researchers say climate warming is the likely cause.
The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments on the proposed listing until April 9.
Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, the lead author of the petition seeking to list polar bears as threatened, said the new study highlights the scope of changes in the Arctic.
When asked for the administration's position with which the Alaska scientists would have to be familiar, Hall said, "The Earth is warming, and we have to understand how to deal with that and to slow down greenhouse gases and manage the changes that will occur," he said.
"That whole aspect of climate change is beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act," the Interior secretary said.
The sample memos, described as to be used in writing travel requests, indicate that the employee seeking permission to travel "understands the administration's position on climate change, polar bears, and sea ice and will not be speaking on or responding to these issues."
The bear is entirely dependent on sea ice, using it as a platform on which to travel, hunt and give birth.
Environmentalists hope that invoking the Endangered Species Act protections might eventually lead the government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases blamed for warming the atmosphere.
Once protection for the polar bear is finalized, federal agencies and other large greenhouse gas emitters will be required to ensure that their emissions do not jeopardize the species.
The Bush administration could refuse only by denying the science of global warming.
The federal agency responsible for protecting Arctic polar bears has barred two Alaska scientists from speaking about polar bears, climate change or sea ice at international meetings in the next few weeks, a move that environmentalists say is censorship.
Faced with incontrovertible evidence that polar bears are imperiled, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne agreed recently to designate polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt protections so polar bears would be present for future generations.
Fish and Wildlife Service did not fully consider the effects of global warming, such as diminished sea ice, when it wrote regulations allowing for incidental harassment of polar bears and walruses by the oil and gas industry in the Beaufort Sea and nearby coastal areas.
Three conservation groups sued the federal government in December 2005 seeking protections for polar bears under the law, blaming global warming for melting of sea ice, the animals' primary habitat.
Environmentalists who petitioned for the new protections for polar bears hope that a listing would force mandatory limits to greenhouse gases.
And the only way to avoid jeopardizing the polar bear is to reduce emissions.
The administration proposed the polar bear designation only after environmental groups petitioned for it and then sued to force a decision.
"What the administration wants to know is who is going to be spokesperson and do they understand administration policy.
So protecting the polar bear was the only decision it could legally make.
According to the memos, agency scientists must obtain a memorandum designating which official, if any, is allowed to respond to questions, particularly about polar bears, and include "a statement of assurance that these individuals understand the Administration's position on these issues."
Officials for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage had not seen the lawsuit and had no immediate reaction.
The Fish and Wildlife Service is authorized to issue regulations for five-year periods for such incidental activity, with the latest issued in August.
Kieran Suckling, policy director of the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that submitted the petition to list the polar bear, said muzzling of scientists at international meetings isn't appropriate.
There is no way administration officials can hope to help the polar bear population to recover if its officials do not acknowledge the science of global warming  that industrial emissions are altering the atmosphere and contributing to rapid warming in the polar regions and elsewhere.
In 2004, we filed a petition seeking protection for the staghorn and elkhorn corals, species that have declined by more than 90 percent because of a host of threats, including global warming.
It is a rare acknowledgement by the administration that global warming is already causing wide environmental impacts, particularly in polar regions.
We think that a decision was made to omit," he said.
Environmental activists, hunters and oil industry representatives spoke at a public hearing on whether the U.S. government should list polar bears as a threatened species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service this week held the first of several hearings in Alaska and Washington on the question.
"We are not gagging scientists," said Hall.
Not even an administration dead set against mandatory curbs on carbon emissions can deny that the habitat of the polar bear, as Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne put it the other day, ``may literally be melting.''
They are not threatened at the moment.
"We need to ultimately recognize the threat that global warming poses not just to polar bears but countless other species, from Caribbean corals to the California butterflies to us as well," said Melissa Waage of the Center for Biological Diversity at Monday night's hearing.
"The Interior Deparment has pretty much explicitly said that they don't think they have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emission, but we know that the Endangered Species Act goes well beyond these walls, that it's taken into account by other agencies," said Kert Davies, research director for Greenpeace.
Greenland on Thursday said it would cut its annual quota for its polar bear hunt as the animal was threatened by climate change.
"Threatened" means a species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.
That category is second to "endangered" on the government's list of species believed most likely to become extinct.
"We need to see where this is going to finally end up with the polar bear, but we're asking those questions," he said.
Polar bears live most of their lives on sea ice, which is diminishing in an Arctic region warming much faster than more temperate regions of the globe.
The documents make the subjects of polar bears, climate change and sea ice off limits to all scientists who haven't been cleared to speak on the topics.
Singing this tired tune, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal last week called the proposal to protect polar bears a ``triumph of politics over science,'' arguing that polar bears are ``overly abundant'' and that the species cannot be considered threatened until its population has declined further.
Polar bears depend on sea ice so they can travel and float to hunt seal and to reach coastal areas off Greenland, Canada, Alaska, Russia and Scandinavia.
Yet each year, as the Arctic warms, the sea ice shrinks.
From burying the National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the United States to trying to gag top NASA climate scientist James Hansen, the Bush administration systematically has attempted to suppress science on global warming.
They can speak with other scientists at international gatherings in conversations or at dinner but may not speak for the United States government in a formal setting, he said.
Kempthorne would not specify how climate change effects on possibly threatened species might alter the administration's opposition to mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
At present, the administration prefers voluntary programs to cut emissions and has taken the position that carbon dioxide, the predominate greenhouse gas, can't be regulated as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.
Two conservation groups sued the federal government Tuesday, claiming regulators are not doing enough to protect polar bears and walruses against the combined threat of energy exploration and global warming.
"If you want to know what's going to be happening in the rest of the world in 25 years, all you have to know is what's happening in the Arctic," Siegel said.
What is remarkable about the polar bear decision is that it is a rare case of science actually triumphing over politics, not the other way around.
Considering the high-profile nature of climate change and the issues that might come up, it was prudent to know ahead of time what everyone was going to discuss, he said.
"We don't know what the motivation was.
"Data that we will get from this ... that's going to be a part of the information that's brought into the bigger discussion on climate change," he said.
"Please be advised that all foreign travel requests (SF 1175 requests) and any future travel requests involving or potentially involving climate change, sea ice and/or polar bears will also require a memorandum from the regional director to the director indicating who'll be the official spokesman on the trip and the one responding to questions on these issues, particularly polar bears."
The Fish and Wildlife Service's review comes amid concerns that global warming is melting away the icy habitats where the animals live.
Over the past week, biologists and wildlife officials received a cover note and two sample memorandums to be used as a guide in preparing travel requests.
Inhofe and the Wall Street Journal would take no action to protect polar bears until their population has declined significantly.
From 1985 to 1994, 62 percent of the female polar bears in the study dug dens on sea ice.
A spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska, Bruce Woods, confirmed the authenticity of the notes, but interpreted them differently.
About 30 people in the crowd showed their support for the animal by sporting orange life perservers and white baseball caps with a polar bear face and ears.
One of them, 8-year-old Kate Muffett of Washington, said, "I am also affected by polar bears disappearing for I would love to see polar bears."
The first, in 2001, was the Kittlitz's murrelet, a small seabird that feeds at the mouth of tidewater glaciers and whose decline corresponds to the global-warming-induced retreat of those glaciers.
Chris Miller, a real estate agent from Woodbridge, Virginia, expressed a personal connection to the animal after she came face to face with a polar bear on a trip to Canada.
The designation means the federal government must come up with a recovery plan for bears in its jurisdiction off the coasts of Alaska.
The Journal got it wrong in every respect.
One study estimates that a third of the Earth's creatures will be condemned to extinction by 2050.
That could include oil and gas exploration, commercial shipping or even releases of toxic contaminants or climate-affecting pollution.
She now heads an environmental consulting firm, Alaska Conservation Solutions.
Internal memos circulated in the Alaskan division of the U.S.
But it did occur, it shouldn't occur again, and I don't believe it will."
KNAPK president John Billmann criticised the authorities for not having stuck to plans to allow the killing of 203 bears.
"This sure sounds like a Soviet-style directive to me," Williams said.
The decision was taken after consultation with local authorities and the Greenland Hunters and Fishers Association (KNAPK), said Heinrich, who spoke to AFP by telephone from Greenland's capital Nuuk.
"We have decided on this reduction in the 2007 quota to be more in line with a level suggested by biologists, who wanted an even lower number," a ministry of fisheries and hunting official, Ole Heinrich, told AFP.
The quota for 2007 has now been reduced to 139 in the semi-autonomous Danish territory.
Polar bears can suffer harm from drilling, seismic work and transportation, said Earthjustice attorney Clayton Jernigan, who filed the lawsuit on behalf the California-based groups.
Offices in Washington, D.C., closed early Tuesday because of a winter storm.
Hunters, who can get up to 2,685 euros (3,500 dollars) for a bear pelt, had been killing around 250 bears a year before the first quota of 150 kills was introduced for 2006.
The Marine Mammal Protection Act imposes a general moratorium on the taking of marine mammals.
"One of my adages is 'If in doubt, don't,' " he said.
Cuddly, loveable animals  even ferocious ones that can kill a seal with a single blow of a monster-strong paw  have a way of precipitating steps that non-furry creatures just can't manage.
"The scientific underpinnings of the proposal are woefully inadequate," said Richard Krause, senior director of regulatory relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
"Rather than basing the proposal on direct scientific observations, the Service bases its proposal on speculative predictions and assumptions that may or may not be valid."
The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post:
Environmentalists are trying to use such a listing to force the United States to restrict heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to global warming as a way of limiting risks to the 22,000 or so bears in the far north.
The Bush administration has been under fire for several years for allegedly trying to curb the speech of government scientists who produce studies that contradict the administration's positions, particularly on global warming.
"That type of memo might be appropriate for the State Department and purely political issues," he said.
The significance of the polar bear decision has not been missed by those who stand to benefit from a continuation of the administration's head-in-the-sand approach to global warming.
Tina Kreisher, communications director of the Interior Department, which oversees the wildlife agency, said in an interview Thursday that the government isn't trying to silence scientists from talking about their findings  but they don't want them to make policy statements.
"The cover memo makes it clear nobody is being told they can't talk about these issues," Woods said.
"What we're dealing with here is science.
This proposal marks the first legally binding admission by the Bush administration of the reality of global warming.
But others said listing the polar bear as threatened could hurt the hunting industry, whose revenues help local economies.
Beaufort Sea polar bear females use coastal land or sea ice for digging snow caves to give birth.
Absent political action from the United States and the world, the rest of us might be as well.
Absent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, the summer sea ice, and the polar bear, might disappear entirely in less than 40 years.
In a conference call to reporters, Kempthorne said his department is not taking a position on why the ice is melting or what to do about it.
Williams, an attorney who received the documents about rules for scientists' speech, was special assistant to the secretary of the Interior under the Clinton administration for six years.
Predictably, opponents of emissions cuts are doing what they always have done: claim a scientific dispute where none exists and urge that no action be taken until the science is ``conclusive.''
They should be out on the ice hunting seals, but earlier breakup of sea ice means the bears are stuck on land, where they are more likely to be spotted.
Polar bears depend on sea ice for their main prey  ringed seals and bearded seals.
It's completely inappropriate to ban scientists from talking about science."
Yet with global warming, these kings are watching their kingdom melt away.
But five of the 19 distinct polar bear populations are already known to be declining.
With the loss of sea ice, the worldwide population of polar bears  estimated at about 20,000 to 25,000  has steadily declined.
The agencies challenged scientists over studies revealing negative effects of oil development on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the drownings of polar bears possibly associated with shrinking sea ice.
The hunting of bear cubs and pregnant bears is banned.
And given the undisputed trajectory of sea ice retreat, the species must still be considered threatened even if there were not yet any evidence of population decline.
Greenland and Norway have the most polar bears, while a quarter of them live mainly in Alaska and travel to Canada and Russia.
The Bush administration has done everything in its power to do as little as possible about climate change.
While U.S. officials have limited ability to do much by themselves to slow and reverse this warming, it is long past time for them to take the blinders off and lead a global effort to reduce emissions.
That was the basis for the strategy of my organization, the Center for Biological Diversity, when, on Feb. 16, 2005 (the same day the Kyoto Protocol entered into force without the participation of the U.S.), we filed a petition requesting protection of the polar bear.
Siegel is a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is dedicated to the conservation of imperiled plants and animals.
"It's a gag order," said Deborah Williams, a former high-level Interior Department official in Anchorage, Alaska, who received documents on Wednesday from Alaska scientists who chose to remain unnamed.
Notwithstanding the scientific consensus that polar bears are threatened with extinction because of global warming, there always will be fossil fuel-addicted naysayers misrepresenting reality.
"Endangered" means a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Political appointees at NASA have turned down journalists' requests for interviews with scientists, and the Minerals Management Service has allowed journalists to interview scientists, including on polar bear observations, only if the agency could record them.
And by 'we,' I mean not only those in the department, but we the public, the policy-makers," Kempthorne told The Associated Press.
Just as the tobacco industry always could find a ``scientist'' to claim that there was no link between smoking and lung cancer, climate-change deniers such as Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., always will find polar bear population numbers and trends that purport to prove that the species is doing fine.
Limits on government scientists' freedom to speak freely about climate change became a heated issue last year after news reports showed that political appointees at NASA had canceled journalists' interview requests with climate scientists and discouraged news releases on global warming.
Electronic copies of the memos and cover note were forwarded to The New York Times by Deborah Williams, an environmental campaigner in Alaska and a former Interior Department official in the Clinton administration.
Yet the reality of global warming has a way of intruding even on the most willfully heedless of politicians.
Scientists in the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been chastised for speaking to reporters, and some have been asked to submit papers and lectures to high-level managers for review.
A study by NASA and Canadian Wildlife Service scientists published in September 2006 in the journal Arctic demonstrated that more polar bears were indeed being seen on land  not because the species was ``overly abundant'' but because the bears had nowhere else to go.
From 1998 to 2004, just 37 percent gave birth on sea ice.
The department has been negotiating with 22 companies to recoup nearly $1 billion (euro750 million ) in lost royalties so far.
What's more, it's hard to see how one could act to preserve polar bear habitat without taking steps to reduce fossil fuel consumption and slow the rate of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity and Pacific Environment, asks the federal court to declare the regulations illegal and force the agency to thoroughly analyze how global warming and oil exploration and development affect the mammals.
He described the content of the documents as part of a policy to establish an agenda and the appropriate spokesperson for international meetings.
But Patterk Netser, an environmental minister for the Nunavut Territory of Canada, said: "They are not endangered.
Only hunters who are granted special permits are allowed to hunt polar bears.
Unfortunately for the polar bear, the ``best available science''  in fact, the only available science  paints a grim picture.
"The president has put very strong emphasis on this, to examine this whole issue of climate change."
"This is an issue of international significance, and you want your professional public servants to be able to discuss these issues.
It's not saying you won't talk about it."
"The fact that we went ahead and said we need to do a proposed listing says that we're willing to look at the data and step forward."
It remains unclear whether such a listing will be issued.
These species are, unfortunately, just the tip of the extinction iceberg.
Such a listing would have symbolic and practical importance.
Polar bears are the kings of the Arctic, having adapted to an environment where few predators can survive.
Under the heading "Foreign Travel  New Requirement  Please Review and Comply Importance: High," the cover note said:
There is a complete ban on the hunting of polar bears between July 1 and September 30.
It held a public hearing last week in Anchorage, Alaska, and another is scheduled for Wednesday in Barrow, Alaska.
The rest instead dug dens on land, according to the study by three U.S. Geological Survey researchers.
Polar bear populations are already suffering from drowning, starvation and lower cub survival.
More polar bears are being seen near human settlements in Canada, they say, therefore polar bear populations must be increasing.
The most studied population, in the West Hudson Bay of Canada, dropped 22 percent from 1987 to 2004.
By law, the total effect on the population must be negligible.
Six companies have reached agreements that would reap the government $1.42 billion (euro1.07 billion) in additional royalties from future production under the flawed leases.
Hansen, the NASA climate scientist, repeatedly has warned that merely keeping up the current pace of emissions for 10 more years will irreversibly alter the Earth's climate.
"Everything is changing, and not for the better."
However, the ``best available science'' standard required by the Endangered Species Act forbids political and economic considerations.
"In recent years, Arctic pack ice has formed progressively later, melted earlier, and lost much of its older and thicker multiyear component," said wildlife biologist Anthony Fischbach, the study's lead author.
Still, when confronted with the need to make a decision, it made the right one  and thereby set the stage for action down the road.
Polar bears might not be extinct until 2040, but that doesn't mean we have 30 years to do nothing.
Yet it is a half-baked acknowledgment.
Such a decision could have broader repercussions.
Bears that continued to den on ice moved away from ice that was thinner or unstable.
The lawsuit focuses on the legal "incidental taking" of polar bears and walruses, a broad definition that covers killing and harassment.
Warmer temperatures have caused the Arctic ice cap to melt, shrinking the bears' hunting grounds and making it increasingly difficult for them to find food.
"I feel I have a responsibility," Miller said.
If sea levels rise 18 feet or more, a large proportion of the world's human population will be displaced  or worse.
Congress created limited exceptions for occurrences incidental to a specific activity, such as drilling for oil and gas.
"I worked very closely with Fish and Wildlife and other Interior agencies, and a memo like this is truly inconceivable," she said.
Two of the memos are copies of those prepared for Craig Perham and Janet E. Hohn, who are traveling to Russia and Norway this month and in April.
At a news conference, Fish and Wildlife Director H. Dale Hall denied that the memos were a form of censorship.
A government leasing mistake on the deep-water leases issued in 1998-99 for the Gulf of Mexico omitted a provision that would have triggered royalty payments once the market price for the oil or gas reached a certain level.
On another matter, Kempthorne said he intends to fix the problem of lost oil and gas royalties from Clinton administration contracts with oil companies.
That could wind up costing the government an estimated $10 billion (euro7.5 billion) eventually.
Though bears are powerful swimmers, at some point they might face daunting distances of open water to reach denning habitat on shore.
Alas, the eyes of the world did not turn to the plight of the Kittlitz's murrelet, as we had hoped, and the administration quietly refused to protect it, a decision we are challenging in court.
Some scientists project a further 30 percent decline by midcentury as Earth continues to warm.
In November, we petitioned to protect 12 penguin species, including the ice-dependent emperor penguin.
The listing is opposed by Alaska Republican Governor Sarah Palin, who has said listing polar bears has the potential to damage the Alaska economy without any benefit to polar bear numbers or their habitat.
The rule was issued last month by the U.S.
The study suggests the local bear population could be harmed if warming continues.
Some speakers said scientific evidence supports the listing and urged the U.S.
Four dead polar bears floating in Arctic Ocean waters, which may be attributed to the long swim from the diminishing sea ice to land, were shown by former Vice President Al Gore in his documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth."
The beloved furry Arctic animal has become a symbol for the dire effects of a warming world.
Ten months into the job, Kempthorne, a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator, said he sent employees reminders on ethical behavior and taken other steps to avoid the kinds of questions about conflicts of interest that dogged Interior officials under his predecessor, Gale Norton.
All this has been documented in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
Female walruses follow the receding ice edge north in spring and summer, using the ice as a platform to dive to the bottom and feed while calves remain up top.
Unfortunately, the threat to these majestic giants of the North is all too real.
A final decision on the listing is due by January 2008.
The petroleum activities disturb feeding, cause abandonment of maternity dens and disrupt polar bear life cycles, Jernigan said.
According to NASA, the Arctic Ocean has lost about 20 percent of its sea ice since the 1970s, an area of 502,000 square miles  twice the size of Texas.
If a ship starts taking on water, you don't wait until the first passenger drowns before issuing a the passengers are clearly ``threatened'' as soon as the water starts pouring in.
"He gave me a second chance and I feel I owe it to them to try to give back."
We have an abudance of them in our area."
A formal designation, following a lengthy period of comment and analysis, would acknowledge that the law compels action at least to mitigate the effects of global climate change.
The agency would frown on their going to news conferences in a host country, he added.
