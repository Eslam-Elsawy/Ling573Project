Postmenopausal women who live in areas with higher air pollution levels have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and of dying from it, said the study by researchers at the University of Washington.
The researchers found that people who reportedly have been physically or sexually abused, or rejected by their mothers at a young age, were twice as likely to have significant levels of C-reactive protein in their blood.
Congenital heart disease (CHD) has become more prevalent among adults as well as children, according to a latest study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.
"This is the first study to measure the changing number of patients in a North American population during a period of major progress in the management of CHD," said Ariane J. Marelli, M.D., lead author of the study and director of the McGill Adult Unit for Congenital Heart Disease Excellence at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
"Between 1985 and 2000, the group of patients that rose the most rapidly were adults with severe CHD, so, as of 2000, there was a nearly equal number of children and adults with severe CHD," Marelli said
"This might be a way to help inform the discussion between a doctor and patient about whether their risk of developing another heart attack or failure in the future is so high that they are willing to undergo an intervention like a bypass surgery," she said.
After taking other factors into consideration, such as age, smoking, diabetes and body mass index, the researchers found that the men with gum disease were 63 percent more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those without gum disease.
Furthermore, more adults have had CHD than children since 1985, and a preponderance are women, the study found.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in three deaths.
Swarovski also boasts a collection of Go Red for Women items, including a heart ring ($170) and its signature red dress pin ($50).
But the protective effect of statins was only seen in patients with comparatively short telomeres.
"So we studied 1,000 people who already had heart disease, and we were interested in determining whether we could predict who would go on to have another heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or die," she said.
The researchers stressed that the findings need to be confirmed and explored by additional research, but it is not the first time that periodontal disease has been associated with other serious illness.
In 2000, the study indicated that one of every 85 children had CHD and one of 250 adults had CHD.
Extrapolating the study findings to the U.S. population, Marelli estimated 1.8 million Americans had CHD in 2000 and that this number is increasing and will have implications for women, pregnancy and genetics.

For years, doctors and scientists have suspected that another property of statins, unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering ability, explained how they protected patients from heart disease and stroke so effectively.
British researchers have found why childhood trauma caused by abuse increases a person's risk of developing disease later in life, the New Scientist reported in it latest issue on Saturday.
Researchers from Leicester and Glasgow Universities in the United Kingdom found that people who have much shorter telomeres are more likely to suffer from heart attacks.
"Our goal is to determine who are the high risk patients, so we can target medical and surgical therapies we know to be life-saving to those most likely to benefit," said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, whose research was published in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Scientists have new evidence that gum disease may be linked to more serious health problems, in this case pancreatic cancer.
The study is the first to look at new cases of cardiovascular disease, not just death.
Reducing fine particulate air pollution could result in less cardiovascular disease and fewer deaths, the study stated.
It remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women and accounts for 16.7 million total deaths worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization.
During February, the American Heart Association is launching a national "Go Red for Women" campaign to raise awareness as well as funds for research and education.
THE QUESTION When the heart is under stress, the blood appears to contain higher levels of a protein known as NT-proBNP.
The study says that measuring the length of telomeres in middle-aged men could help pinpoint those most at risk of heart disease and direct them to statin treatment.
After four years they found that the higher the level of the peptide in the blood at the outset, the higher their chances were for having an adverse cardiac event.
During this time, 256 of the participants had a heart attack or stroke, developed heart failure or died.
Previous research suggested that people with infected gums may be more prone to heart disease.
Women with the gene variant were four times more likely to show signs of coronary artery disease than women without, the researchers at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute in California said.
It was also the first to look at air pollution levels within cities.

Doctors soon may be employing a simple blood test to help them determine which heart patients are at greatest risk for heart attack, stroke and death.
"The (peptide test) properly identified people at high risk for dying, even with ejection fraction was OK," he said.
They also found that statins, which are better known for their cholesterol- lowering properties, appeared to alleviate the effects of telomere damage and may even protect telomeres against degradation.
"This gives us more markers to help identify high-risk individuals," he said.
The researchers found that in the placebo group, the risk of heart disease was almost double among the men with short telomeres compared with counterparts with long telomeres.
Samani said exactly how statins might limit the damage caused by telomere shortening or even directly protect telomeres was " speculation at this stage," but his group has already begun laboratory studies to test how the drugs interact with telomeres.
The researchers eventually found both patients and controls with the shortest telomeres were twice as likely to have developed serious heart disease,
The risk of heart disease is higher than previously thought, and there can be substantial variations within individual cities, said the study.
"The risk of having a cardiovascular event, that is, a heart attack, stroke or needing bypass surgery, or of dying of a cardiovascular cause, was increased," said study senior author Dr. Joel Kaufman, professor of environmental and occupational medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington.
Previous studies have suggested that childhood trauma increases a person's risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and other disorders normally associated with obesity in adulthood.
The median age in 1985 was 11 years compared to 17 years in 2000.
The most significant increases in CHD were in adolescents (13 to 17 years old) and in young adults (18 to 25), according to the study.
She estimated about 900,000 adults and 900,000 children had CHD.
The median age of those with severe CHD increased markedly from 1985 to 2000.
The study measured prevalence, age and proportion of adults relative to children at four time points: 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000, and analyzed the Quebec administrative databases recorded for the general population where access to health care is universal.

For example, patients whose heart peptide levels put them in the top quarter of those tested, had a nearly 8-fold increased rate of cardiovascular events or death compared with those whose peptide levels were lowest.
Study authors emphasized, however, that the test should not replace others used to determine cardiac risks and that it will not likely be used routinely until additional research is done.
In the five-year research, they first took blood samples from 484 middle-aged men with moderately raised cholesterol and from 1058 control subjects, and compared the telomere lengths in their white blood cells.
But the good news was that in the statin group, those with short telomeres enjoyed a substantial cut in the risk of heart disease.
The heart peptide test might help decide, for example, whether a patient needs coronary artery bypass surgery, considered a highly effective, but risky approach to cardiovascular disease.
Bibbins-Domingo and her colleagues wondered whether the test also could be used to determine the long-term prognosis of patients with a history of heart problems.
The gradual erosion of telomeres, the strands of DNA capping chromosomes that wear away with each cell division, may play a pivotal role in heart disease, and drugs called statins may limit the damage, the New Scientist reported on Friday on its website.
Air pollution poses a greater risk to postmenopausal women, making them more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease, said a new study.
"CHD has been thought of as a disease of childhood, but it has become an important disease of adulthood as well," Marelli said.
Pancreatic cancer strikes more than 33,000 Americans each year and kills more than 30,000, making it the fourth-leading cause of cancer death.

The research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals.
"They mostly come from combustion of fossil fuels, although vegetative burning has an impact in some cities," Kaufman said.
Nonetheless, conclusive evidence about a treatment's effectiveness is rarely found in a single study.
The study did not provide data comparing the test with existing tests.
Anyone considering changing or beginning treatment of any kind should consult with a physician.
The scientists relied on data the University of Iowa gathered through a continual study of 11,377 people since 1971 in Muscatine, Iowa.
The risk of a complication, especially heart failure, increased as the NT-proBNP level rose.
The research team now plans further work to measure glucocorticoid levels in people who were exposed to stress during childhood.
The most surprising finding was that the test accurately predicted a high risk, even when traditional assessments such as treadmill stress tests and echocardiography failed to confirm it.
"In patients whose telomeres were wearing away at a normal rate, statin treatment didn't make any difference.
This suggests that statins were protecting against the worst cases of telomere degradation.
Of that group, 134 people had the highest protein level among all the participants and 23 had the lowest.
Non-smokers with gum disease were twice as likely to develop the hard-to-treat cancer as those with healthy gums.
Without statins they might have been even shorter," Leicester University cardiologist Nilesh Samani, who led the research, was quoted as saying.
``Our study provides the first strong evidence that periodontal disease may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer,'' said Michaud, who reported the findings in today's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
A certain gene variant predisposes women to heart disease, a new US study has found, offering clues to the origins of heart attacks and strokes.
About 77 percent of the women with the gene variant experienced early signs of heart attack and stroke.
The higher and longer the exposure to air pollution, the bigger the threat to postmenopausal women, warned the study appearing on the HealthDay News website.
The lead author is Nilesh Samani, a professor of cardiovascular science at the University of Leicester, central England.
"We need to increase public awareness for congenital heart disease in order to be able to better care for the increasing number of young people with heart disease," Marelli said.
"For comparison purposes, cystic fibrosis occurs in one of 4,500 live births, so there are 45 times more children with CHD than children with cystic fibrosis and most of these children are nowbecoming adults," Marelli said.
Marelli considers CHD a major public health problem in North America that is largely under-recognized.
"This is the largest population study of CHD to have been performed in North America," Marelli said.
Quebec accounts for 25 percent of Canada's population.
"There is no reason to believe that the predominantly Caucasian population of Quebec and Canada is different from the United States."

The blood test, which takes less than an hour to complete, measures levels of a substance known cryptically as N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide, or NT-proBNP.
The peptide, and its cousin, brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released from the lower chambers of the heart when it is under stress.
Researchers studying inflammation in the bloodstream at King's College London monitored 1,000 people in New Zealand from birth to the age of 32, noting any factors that created stress, and recorded levels of C-reactive protein in their blood, which is a marker of inflammation and has been linked to heart disease.
Elevated levels of the peptide in the blood mean the heart is working too hard.
And it's now proven an excellent predictor of the severe consequences of heart disease, even when other, more routine tests are negative.
British doctors measured the length of telomeres in the chromosomes of white blood cells among men aged 45-64 who had enrolled in a big study on coronary prevention in western Scotland.
"I think it's the wave of the future," he said.
The lower the percentage, the higher the risk of death, he explained.
Traditionally, the best test to predict a patient's high risk of dying from heart disease is echocardiography, which can detect a weak heart muscle, said Dr. David Roberts, a cardiologist and medical director of the catheterization laboratory at Sutter Medical Center.
Shorter telomeres indicate older cells and are thus a marker of biological ageing, which varies according to the individual.
Telomeres get shorter each time a cell divides.
THIS STUDY involved 987 people, mostly men, with stable coronary artery disease who were given blood and urine tests, treadmill tests and echocardiograms and were monitored for nearly four years.
Until now, however, doctors have limited the test's use to confirmation of heart failure, a progressive illness in which the heart can no longer efficiently pump blood to other organs and muscles.
The test has been used for years in hospital emergency rooms to confirm a diagnosis of heart failure.
Specifically, Bibbins-Domingo said, researchers need to determine whether the assessment tool can lead to better, more appropriate therapies and ultimately improved outcomes for patients.
Because nearly all the participants were white, it's unclear whether the findings would prove true in other ethnic and racial groups, Lammer said.
Telomeres  nubby strips of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes  predict a man's risk of developing heart disease, according to study published in Saturday's issue of The Lancet.
Over time, the bacterial infection that causes gum disease can also cause loss of the bone that anchors the teeth, and the inflammation from the infection may set the stage for other serious diseases.
Children's Oakland researchers identified the gene variant in female participants.
The study was published in the American Heart Association's journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.

Common heart disease drug therapies such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics can decrease the levels, making BNP and NT-proBNP effective markers for cardiac conditions.
Blood test may warn of complications.
The researchers believe that stress induces abnormal levels of inflammation in children, which has repercussions in adulthood.
That test, which uses sonography, measures the ejection fraction, or the percentage of blood squeezed out by the heart each time it beats.
Constant stress could also reduce a child's ability to produce glucocorticoid hormones, which are the main mechanism the body uses to turn off inflammation, Danese holds, hoping his work will help people identify those at risk of developing heart disease at an earlier age.
The same Scottish study also randomly assigned some volunteers to receive statins, a drug which breaks down artery-clogging cholesterol.
Roberts said he would put the peptide test in the same category as calcium scoring, a cardiac testing approach that uses an X-ray to determine the amount of calcium buildup on artery walls.
"Inflammation is a natural response to physical trauma such as cutting yourself or getting an infection," Andrea Danese who led the research was quoted as saying.
If the heart does not get enough blood, chest pain and heart attack can result and, over time, heart failure or arrhythmias can develop.
A patient who comes into the emergency room with shortness of breath, for example, may be given the test to rule out other causes of the symptom, such as asthma.
"If it is high, you better take a close look at that person and maybe do some more testing."
CAVEATS Whether the findings apply to women remains unclear.
According to the AHA, only 13 percent of women view heart disease as a health threat, yet it is the No.
Congenital heart defects are structural problems arising from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels near the heart that occurs before birth.
An estimated 71 million Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.

The 484 men who went on to develop coronary heart disease had shorter telomeres than the 1,058 men who remained disease-free, the investigators discovered.
About 750 participants in the long-term study agreed to give DNA samples and comply with regular checkups over the years.
Findings from the University of California San Francisco will not immediately change the way patients with symptoms of heart trouble are assessed, but may eventually play a key role in guiding doctors to treatment decisions.
People with coronary artery disease, which occurs when plaque builds up on arteries that supply blood to the heart, narrowing them and limiting blood flow.
The research adds to the burgeoning field of genetics and personalized medicine, where people could learn early in life what diseases they are most susceptible to and make lifestyle choices to reduce risk.
The discoveries made by Samani's team provide important new insights into the causes of arterial disease.
The study controlled for diet, smoking and other risk factors.
Fine particulate matter is comprised of tiny particles of soot or dust carried in the air.
Most heart defects either obstruct blood flow in the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal way.
