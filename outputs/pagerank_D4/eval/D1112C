Romero, 53, was one of the 11 killed when Alvarez drove his SUV onto the tracks in Glendale on Jan. 26, 2005, causing a disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
Defense attorneys had argued that Alvarez was only trying to kill himself when he drove his gasoline-soaked Jeep on train tracks in suburban Glendale.
"On that day, Mr. Alvarez murdered 11 people," Monaghan said.
 The man who caused the 2005 Metrolink train derailment that left 11 dead was "violent" and "dangerous" and considered killing people in the days leading up to the crash, he said Wednesday during cross-examination in his murder trial.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty after charging him with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
He then decided that getting hit by a train would be a more efficient way to kill himself, his attorney said.
The life-or-death decision about the fate of a man convicted of murdering 11 people by causing a commuter train derailment in 2005 was placed in the hands of jurors after his lawyer told them: "You are not here to be avenging angels.
Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan pounded Juan Manuel Alvarez for details about threats he admitted making to kill or injure his then-estranged wife, his cousin and others before he parked his SUV on railroad tracks in Glendale, causing the Jan. 26, 2005, collision.
Alvarez said after he decided not to kill himself, he tried but could not move the sport utility vehicle.
He said he ditched that plan because he thought it would be "too painful," and decided to kill himself by parking his SUV on the train tracks instead.
A judge has refused to dismiss murder charges against a man accused of causing a 2005 Los Angeles train crash that killed 11 people.
A murder defendant apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter train disaster that killed 11 people, testifying that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
A murder defendant apologized Tuesday for causing a commuter train disaster that killed 11 people, testifying that he was trying to kill himself and never meant to harm anyone else.
Cathryn Brogham, deputy district attorney, said Alvarez's actions that day were part of a consistent pattern in which he tried to get his estranged wife's attention, this time by killing people.
A man found guilty of murder for causing a Los Angeles train crash that left 11 people dead should be jailed for life without parole, a jury recommended on Tuesday.
The resulting crash killed 11 people and injured about 180.
Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham said in opening statements last month that Alvarez had threatened to kill his wife and staged the accident to get her attention.

Alvarez parked his sport utility vehicle on railroad tracks, causing a Metrolink train to derail and strike another Metrolink train going the other direction on Jan. 26, 2005.
Under earlier questioning Tuesday from defense attorney Thomas Kielty, Alvarez said that's when he decided to douse himself with gasoline and kill himself.
The 25-year-old Compton man, who drove his SUV onto the tracks at Chevy Chase Drive in Glendale, stands accused of 11 counts of murder, along with arson and train-wrecking charges.
Alvarez said several times that he did not think anyone else would be hurt and had no idea that the train could derail.
Alvarez shot back that it appeared that Monaghan was trying to say he intended to kill people on the train, which he denies.
Jurors did not seem as moved emotionally as they were during the prosecution's presentation of testimony from family and friends of the victims of the Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train derailment.
The same panel that found Juan Alvarez guilty of 11 counts of first-degree murder was asked Monday to recommend whether he be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
But when Train 100 derailed, it slammed into him, and he was killed.
He said he then drove onto railroad tracks northeast of Los Angeles in Glendale, hoping a train would smash into his vehicle and kill him quickly.

Prosecutors portrayed Juan Manuel Alvarez, the man accused of murder, as an egomaniac meth user who wanted to kill people as a way to get attention from his estranged wife.
"Mr. Alvarez did not intend to kill," Belter said.
Prosecutors allege that Alvarez had made not a suicide attempt, but a bid for attention from his wife.

The sentencing phase of the trial follows his conviction last month on 11 counts of first- degree murder.
"Life without parole is not justice for the 11 victims," Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham told the nine women and three men who will decide Alvarez's fate.
As children, Alvarez, his sister and others in the family were sexually molested by an uncle, relatives said on the witness stand.
Monaghan said that Alvarez ripped apart the lives of families whose loved ones were killed in the derailment and that he had forefeited his right to live.
On the witness stand, Juan Alvarez, 29, asked for forgiveness from families of those killed in the January 2005 disaster involving two Metrolink trains.
Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life.
Jurors decided against recommending the death penalty for Alvarez.
Prosecutors said Alvarez had deliberately caused the accident on the Metrolink commuter line on January 26, 2005 to get attention.
The defense claims that Alvarez changed his mind about the suicide and tried unsuccessfully to back the jeep off the tracks, but the vehicle was stuck.
Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan told jurors Monday in opening remarks at the trial for the Metrolink train crash in Glendale, in which 11 passengers and crew died.
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of arson.
But prosecutors said they believe the evidence will show that Alvarez didn't intend to kill himself, just others.
"This leads to lifelong depression," Belter said, citing Alvarez's testimony that he was hearing voices in the weeks before the derailment and that he set out to kill himself that day, not to kill others.
The defense argued that Alvarez's only intent that morning was to kill himself.
About 6 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2005, Metrolink train 100, heading southbound, smashed into Alvarez's SUV before derailing and hitting two more trains, including the northbound Metrolink 901.
The defense contends that after hearing the voices of his estranged wife and "her lover" calling him stupid, coming from the back seat of his dark-green Jeep Cherokee, Alvarez, who was on his way to work at about 5:30 a.m., decided to kill himself.
He did not go drive his vehicle off a mountain."
In closing arguments of the death penalty phase of his trial, a prosecutor asked for the death sentence, depicting the 29-year-old Alvarez as a selfish man who turned his back on every opportunity offered to him when he came to the United States after a childhood in Mexico.
Some relatives of the dead were present as Alvarez testified.

Taking the witness stand, Juan Alvarez, 29, asked for forgiveness from families of those killed in the January 2005 disaster involving two Metrolink trains.
The testimony of family members came on the first day of closing arguments for Alvarez's defense team.
Prosecutors want the jury to recommend that Alvarez be executed instead of spending the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.
"I know some of the family members are here today.
"I know some of the family members are here today.
As well as the 11 fatalities more than 180 other people were injured.
Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder and train wrecking.
Alvarez's defense team, Michael Belter and Thomas Kielty, doesn't deny he drove the SUV onto the tracks.
Alvarez was convicted June 26 of 11 counts of first-degree murder and one count of arson.
The jury also found true the special circumstance of multiple murders, which makes Alvarez eligible for the death penalty.
"He told you himself he had homicidal thoughts that morning," Brougham reminded jurors about Alvarez's testimony.
In addition to Alvarez family members, defense attorneys are expected to elicit testimony from psychiatrists in an attempt to portray the convicted killer in the sympathetic light of a troubled man who was abused as a child by his father and uncle.
I'll regret that for the rest of my life."
Belter asked jurors to recommend life in prison without the possibility of parole for Alvarez, while acknowledging the gravity of his client's deadly actions that irrevocably devastated the victims' families.
The nine women and three men on the jury will decide whether the 29-year-old Compton handyman will get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.
The jury is not expected to reach a verdict on whether to recommend life in prison or death for Alvarez until at least late next week.
Afterward, when Alvarez was jailed on murder charges, his wife withdrew a restraining order she had against him and began visiting him regularly, the prosecutor said.
About 180 other people were injured.
Alvarez's car was hit by a Los Angeles-bound train, which derailed and then ploughed into a train travelling in the opposite direction.
Less moving were the testimony of Alvarez's older cousin Beto Alvarez, who now is helping raise Juan's son and his adopted daughter, and his estranged wife, Carmen, the woman prosecutors say Alvarez was attempting to impress and win back when he caused the disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
"It's not an accident that these people were murdered by him."
Wednesday, he admitted to Monaghan that he has repeatedly lied to people, and the prosecutor noted that in recent months, Alvarez told a doctor he thought that January morning about killing his wife at work "and everybody else."
He reminded jurors of testimony that Alvarez was beaten relentlessly by his father, that he tried to commit suicide when he was just a child and that he saw his pregnant mother beaten until she had a miscarriage.
"Juan Alvarez never imagined that a train would derail or that anybody would die other than himself," Kielty said.
He is charged with 11 counts of murder and one count of arson and train wrecking, along with special-circumstance allegations of multiple murders and train wrecking stemming from the crash.
"Mr. Alvarez used Metrolink 100 as a match to light his vehicle on fire," Monaghan said.
Playing a slide show featuring photos of the victims when they were alive, followed by shots of their bodies in the wreckage, Los Angeles County prosecutors said there is no doubt that Alvarez is guilty of murder for dousing his SUV with gasoline, leaving it on railroad tracks in Glendale and watching the carnage unfold.
"You think, 'Oh, I'll get through this and go on like before,"' he said.
The Los Angeles judge on Thursday denied a defense motion for Juan Manuel Alvarez and said the prosecution presented enough evidence to have the 29-year-old defendant stand trial.
"Life without parole is not an adequate, appropriate punishment," Brougham told jurors.
You are here to be a rational and thinking body."
The train derailment also injured 180 people.
But they place the blame for the deaths on Metrolink and its practice of pushing trains with the locomotive at the rear.
Later, they alleged that Alvarez's motive was actually a bizarre attempt to win the attention of his estranged wife.
Defense lawyers claimed however that Alvarez had parked his car on the tracks to commit suicide but was unable to remove it after he changed his mind at the last minute.
"He would never cry," said his mother.
Alvarez said he poured gas over himself and his Jeep, took out a lighter and then decided he did not want to burn himself to death because it would be too painful.
Alvarez said he poured gas over himself and his Jeep, took out a lighter and then decided he did not want to burn himself to death because it would be too painful.
"You can only begin to imagine the damage that this man has caused," Brougham said of the victims.
Justice will be served by a sentence of life in prison without parole."
Glendale police found his wallet near the scene and arrested him at a friend's house.
The clock read 6:02 a.m. A tremendous collision jarred him awake.
"Each was a unique individual with a future, with a family, with hopes, with dreams."
Fire erupted, fueled by 5,000 gallons of diesel that spewed out across the crash zone.
Police, fire crews and regular, everyday citizens rushed to the scene to pull commuters to safety.
"From the moment he was conceived he was unwanted and unloved."
One juror wiped tears streaming down her cheeks with a tissue and calmed herself by cooling her face with an Asian-style fan.
The testimony given Thursday presented a tragic family from the border town of Mexicali, where the seeds of Alvarez's violence can be traced.
Jurors spent less than an hour deliberating before recessing for the day.
They were to resume their talks Tuesday.
Some settled early, but nearly 60 remain.
The money from the lawsuit, many plaintiffs agree, is secondary.
As his train with three passenger cars zoomed straight for the reflection at nearly 80 mph, he soon realized it was coming from an SUV straddling the tracks.
Three years ago Saturday, Steven Toby settled down for a quick nap and woke up in a nightmare.
The day began with Kielty continuing his direct examination, in which Alvarez admitted that while in custody, he has illegally stored razor blades, sold prescription medicine and made a batch of "pruno"  a homemade alcoholic brew.
And in the most emotional testimony of the day, Alvarez's mother spoke tearfully about being a battered wife for more than two decades at the hands of an alcoholic, drug-addicted husband whose beatings caused the miscarriage of one of her unborn children.
Alvarez's cousin, Otilia Guevara, testified that the same uncle raped her often, even while she visited her grandmother and with the knowledge of her grandmother and several family members.
In Mexicali, the battering continued and it took its toll on Juan to the point that his reticence to communicate led some teachers to believe he was a deaf-mute.
And no one protested or reported the crimes.
She got a restraining order in late 2004 to keep him away from her, their children, as well as his mother and brother, whom Alvarez allegedly threatened to kill.
"For the injured people, even though it's three years later, some can get nervous just seeing a train on TV.
When her husband was deported, Ayala said, she followed him back to Mexico with young Juan, who had been born in the U.S.
In his questioning, Kielty pointed out that Alvarez had been recorded in jail saying he was drug-free and didn't intend on using drugs, in part, because they caused him to hallucinate and "get crazy."
As Train 100 bore down, he leapt out of the passenger side and fled.
"I probably meant everybody else that was spying on me, the people that were following me," he said.
He had fled the Jeep by the time a Metrolink train hit the vehicle, then struck a parked freight train and was struck by another Metrolink train going the other way.
He had fled the Jeep by the time a Metrolink train hit the vehicle, then struck a parked freight train and was struck by another Metrolink train going the other way.
He basically had the American dream," said Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan.
"Juan Alvarez was looking for a place to light himself on fire," said Kielty about the reason Alvarez initially drove his Jeep south, well past the legal traffic barrier at the train crossing at Chevy Chase Drive, between Los Angeles and Glendale.
"That was not in his heart that day.
Possibly preparing for that, prosecutors reminded jurors that Alvarez's brother and sister had also been abused as children, but that they, like most children who have been abused, did not wind up as mass murderers.
During his second day of testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court, Alvarez said he was in good spirits when he woke up that January morning, even taking time to water his landlord's roses before driving off for a meeting about a job.
Having recently won a murder conviction for Juan Manuel Alvarez in Glendale's 2005 Metrolink train disaster, prosecutors kicked off their arguments Monday trying to persuade jurors to sentence the Compton handyman to death.
From the time he was a child, Alvarez was mercilessly beaten for no apparent reason by his father, using fists, belts and electrical cords, several relatives testified.
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 29, was convicted last month at Los Angeles Superior Court following a two-month trial.
Prosecutors challenged parts of the testimony of Alvarez's family members, except for his mother, whom they chose not to cross-examine.
"It feels like it happened yesterday," she said.
"I feel terrible and I ask for forgiveness," Alvarez said.
"I feel terrible and I ask for forgiveness," Alvarez said.
After a series of incidents and suicide or "pretend-suicide" attempts, as the prosecutors called them  such as when Alvarez inflicted wounds on himself or took pills  his wife kicked him out of their home.
"The evidence will clearly show beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alvarez is the individual that parked a jeep that had been doused with gasoline on the southbound tracks."
I never meant to hurt any of your loved ones.
I never meant to hurt any of your loved ones.
That morning, Alvarez, a man who defense witnesses have testified hallucinated that his wife's phantom lover slept in their bed and could fly, thought his wife and her lover were in the back seat of his vehicle, mocking him.
Defense attorney Michael Belter argued that Alvarez's childhood of abuse by a father who was a "monster" and a mother who tried to abort him shaped him into a mentally disturbed man who sought refuge in methamphetamine addiction.
He did not plan his life with a design to kill and ruin all these lives."
Young Alvarez, loved ones testified, was withdrawn and quiet  possibly from the physical abuse, to which relatives said he had grown so accustomed that he no longer cried.
"Before you sentence the man, you take into account not just the offense, you take into account the man," court-appointed lead defense lawyer Michael Belter told jurors at the outset of his closing argument.
"He could have simply walked in front of that train," Brogham said.
He acknowledged the power of testimony from survivors of those killed and said, "There is nothing I can say that would alleviate the tremendous pain and suffering, the loss by these families."
He could face the death penalty if convicted.
He could face the death penalty if convicted.
If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
If convicted, he faces the death penalty.
Of Alvarez, he said, "He is a man for whom death is not warranted.
"I think I'm better now and I'm afraid to take anything," Alvarez said.
"We are not here to offer any excuses or justifications," he said.
When the crash killed her brother, it took away the family historian.
Eleven people died and about 180 were injured.
Someone pulled the stuff off him, but when he tried to get up, he crumpled.
While he's responsible for setting off a "perfect storm" of escalating events that resulted in the death of 11 people, that doesn't make him a murderer, said Thomas Kielty, Alvarez's defense lawyer.
As its front toppled to the side, its rear cars smacked into the northbound Metrolink Train 901.
He fled the Jeep as a commuter train bore down.
"This was Mexico," Ayala said through a translator.
But he changed his mind again, he testified Tuesday, and wanted to live for his children, but couldn't get the stuck SUV off the tracks.
For the engineer of Metrolink 100, the horror of Jan. 26, 2005, came seconds after he noticed an odd reflection on the tracks, about a quarter mile dead ahead.
He filled up two water bottles with gasoline and went to look for a place to light himself on fire.
He said he saw the train's bright lights before jumping out of the vehicle.
Metrolink officials argue that the agency was not at fault and that commuters should not fear getting on the trains.
Metrolink is fighting on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe, and it still uses the push-pull method on all trains.
They're not the only ones blaming the agency.
Moments before she took the stand, Alvarez had turned to look at her and smiled  his only show of emotion to any of his loved ones.
She wanted something permanent, something that would remind people of the terrible day.
Carmen Alvarez told jurors she is now involved in another romantic relationship and plans to move on with her life.
In 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be too impractical and expensive.
The Los Angeles Superior Court has scheduled the criminal trial of Juan Manuel Alvarez for March 24.
Maureen Tutino narrated a slide show of her family's photographs that prosecutor John Monaghan presented to jurors, showing the central role James Tutino had occupied in the lives of his loved ones and the void his death had created.
"He feels he has a right to do whatever he wants to do," the prosecutor said.
"Every time the defense asks you for mercy, think of his conduct in jail.
But he added, "You are here to make a rational decision, not be swayed by emotion. "
Juan Manuel Alvarez's mother, Leticia Ayala, told a jury that he was an unwanted pregnancy and that she had tried, but failed, to abort her unborn son using folk-medicine brews of herbs and leaves as well as traditional medications.
She said he succeeded because after he was jailed on murder charges his wife withdrew a restraining order and visited him regularly.
Alvarez was an admitted methamphetamine user at the time of the crash, although he testified that it had been three or four days since he had used the drug, even though he initially told a doctor it had been longer because he was ashamed and afraid it would make him look bad.
Alvarez's methamphetamine use was so bad and he was so delusional that he thought the CIA was following him and that his wife had a slew of lovers, including one who secretly slept with the couple in their bed, prompting Alvarez to sleep with a knife, Kielty said.
"Juan never intended to derail or burn the train," they wrote in a prepared statement.
It's the subtle things that re-stimulate the terror  these people just can't escape them for the rest of their lives."
Pushed by a massive locomotive, the three-car train bucked upward and crashed down atop the Jeep.
In the years leading up to the crash, Thomas Ormiston, who drove Amtrak and Metrolink trains, grew more and more uncomfortable riding in the front car when the train was being pushed from behind.
Even after her husband abandoned her and her young daughter, Ayala said, she crossed the border from Mexico into the United States illegally on foot  five months pregnant with Juan  to be near the man who regularly physically abused her.
Relatives of the man convicted of murdering 11 Metrolink passengers in a Glendale train derailment said Thursday that he was the product of a violent family that exposed him to incest, rape, substance abuse and drug trafficking over two generations.
But just Wednesday morning, Alvarez took anti-depression medication, he admitted under cross-examination.
The family is involved in a lawsuit against the Metrolink, saying that the push method used to propel the Metrolink 100  where the engine is behind the passenger cars  was unsafe.
"It's almost like I build up to it, I'm fine, I manage to get through the holidays," she said.
Beto Alvarez was on the stand as defense lawyers introduced a message recorded on his home answering machine just minutes after Juan caused the derailment and carnage.
"He didn't just go jump off a bridge.
"It really touched a lot of people's lives," she said.
"Like everyone else, he believed that a locomotive would obliterate his Jeep and just keep going.
After watching gruesome photos and hearing emotional testimony from loved ones of the victims, some jurors were brought to tears as the prosecution pushed its case forward.
Brougham also reminded jurors of testimony that while in jail, Alvarez had dealt drugs, intimidated prisoners and engaged in other behavior inconsistent with a person truly sorry for his actions.
In her closing argument, Brougham presented profiles of each of the 11 people who died, saying family members and friends would attest to the loss and tragedy caused by their deaths.
"I didn't mean to do this, Beto," Juan Alvarez said in the message.
But they were visibly gripped by the accounts of sexual molestation, beatings, emotional abuse and abject family life described by the defense and family members.
Alvarez also admitted passing a friend heroin that had been smuggled in by a new inmate, as well as using extortion and threats against another inmate, a man he said was in custody for child molestation.
Alvarez's attorneys deferred their argument until they begin presenting the defense case, possibly later this week.
"Everybody knows what caused the Glendale wreck  or I should say, who caused it."
"That is not a remorseful, regretful person," she said.
Christine Anthony, who lived a block away from the crash, worked two years to get the memorial erected, then spent most of this year getting it beautified.
For Elaine Siebers-Parent and her brother, Bob, it's the sound of the train whistle in the night that haunts them.
She said she tried to abort her unborn son in Mexico prior to her U.S. journey.
His leg shattered, he managed to pull himself out the door.
Three years, one arrest, 11 deaths and dozens of lawsuits later, the families of the worst disaster in Metrolink history hope their long quest for justice is close to an end.
On the day of the crash, the veteran conductor was in what he thought was the safer locomotive of Train 901.
At first, they called the crash a suicide attempt gone horribly awry.
Yes, Mr. Alvarez was involved, but Metrolink isn't admitting any guilt.
"It is an extremely safe and reliable form of transportation, not to diminish in any way the tragedy that the families of these victims suffered," said Denise Tyrrell, Metrolink spokeswoman.
The prosecution's cross-examination is scheduled to continue this morning.
Allegedly distraught and suicidal, the handyman lodged the SUV on the tracks north of downtown Los Angeles, doused it with gasoline and waited.
In my opinion, they're the ones who are really responsible."
Justice has not been served  yet."
Alvarez, according to Brougham, had acted as a man bent on destruction with no sense of conscience about the havoc he would cause.
For Henry Romero, whose uncle Leonardo Romero was killed in the crash, there's nothing the defense can say to convince him of Alvarez's innocence.
The 51-year-old Shadow Hills man was headed south on Metrolink 100, catching a little shut-eye on his way to his job at Los Angeles City Hall.
That could have been my mom or dad."
That could have been my mom or dad."
As prosecutors continued, the jury could hear the sobs and wails of relatives of Leonardo Romero of Newport Beach.
"And it's like this doom and gloom over my head for the rest of January."
He deeply regrets having unintentionally harmed the victims of this tragic accident."
Their brother, Billy, was on the way to his job as a clerk with the Los Angeles Unified School District.
He and his sister are willing to reopen the old wounds in the hope it will bring change.
The jury appeared equally moved later when prosecutors presented their first two witnesses  the mother and younger brother of James Tutino, 47, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was among the victims.
"I want to see the criminal trial take place.
"It brings back bad memories, but we have to have some kind of closure," he said.
It will start with three separate cases  one on behalf of the survivors of a passenger killed in the crash, one for a man seriously injured and the final for a woman with minor injuries.
"He ran down the aisle and told people to 'Hold on!
"But the consequences reach far beyond me and the people affected that day."
Alvarez testified he had made other suicide attempts, once laying down on a road waiting for a car to run over him and twice stabbing himself.
"Because of the injuries he suffered, I had to say my goodbyes through a coffin, and that's the most difficult thing for me.
Alvarez's response: "I don't consider myself dangerous."
Monaghan said passengers on board the trains screamed in the fiery aftermath.
Alvarez, who'd watched the carnage unfold from beside the tracks, tried to kill himself a second time, cutting his wrists and stabbing himself in the chest with scissors.
The lights went out and Toby heard a mass gasp.
Metrolink is fighting the suit on the grounds that the federal government certified the push-pull method as safe.
They want Metrolink to stop pushing trains and to install better security measures around crossings.
Alvarez, 29, with shorter hair and a goatee, wore a cream-color suit at the opening of his trial.
When prosecutors showed a photograph of Romero  a former Marine and father of three, taken shortly after his death  the family was overcome with emotion.
Eventually, he'd learn to walk again with the aid of a horse-head-top cane, but at the time, all he could think was that he was about to die.
He wanted to open a nursery and spend his spare time fishing in Mammoth with Bob.
And in 2006, a Federal Railroad Administration report found there was not enough evidence to justify always having a locomotive out front, and Metrolink says it would be impractical and expensive.
The 58-year-old Northridge man's widow, Ann, said the anniversary is tough every year.
"Blatant murder is what I think it is," Romero said.
"To suggest he is anything but a troubled person with deep-seated mental illness is to ignore the obvious," Belter said.
"He was kind of the sunshine of our life," said an emotionally wrought Maureen Tutino, "and we miss that."
Instead of baiting hooks, Bob Parent is preparing for the emotional experience of hearing the events unfold once again in court.
A spider web that still ensnares Elaine Siebers-Parent.
Billy Parent, a bachelor who lived alone in Canoga Park, was 53, a few years away from retirement.
Saturday morning, they plan to visit the memorial erected last year by the Atwater Village Neighborhood Council.
By day's end, rescuers retrieved 11 dead bodies from the wreckage and marked 180 wounded.
More than five dozen plaintiffs went after Metrolink in civil court.
Its front car skewed wildly to the west, knocking into a Union Pacific freight on the next track.
When Toby finally oriented himself, debris pinned his leg to the ground.
Tony Tutino, who followed his brother's footsteps into law enforcement, recounted the draining ordeal of learning of James' death  and then the most difficult part: never being "able to go say goodbye to my brother."
There, the Juan Alvarez Sr. family carried out unspeakable acts of extreme machismo and dominance over loved ones.
Juan, whose family friend was killed by a train at a grade crossing a couple of years earlier, thought the train always wins.
Alvarez, 29, sitting dispassionately next to his attorneys, looked at the witnesses during their testimony and occasionally glanced at the photographs that prosecutors displayed on a large screen hanging from a wall in the courtroom.
"The defendant deserves the greater punishment."
"For some families, it's like it happened yesterday  especially for the young mothers and widows," said Clark Aristei, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
And Monaghan highlighted Alvarez's jailhouse problems as proof that he hasn't changed, quoting from a recorded phone conversation in which Alvarez told someone he extorted two $10.75 phone cards and a bag of coffee from another inmate under threats of harm.
Although judges give the final sentence, a jury's recommendation is rarely ignored.
Tutino said one of James' sons, Nick, will be sworn in as a sheriff's deputy July 17 and will be given his father's badge number.
Each night, she still has the urge to call him up to see what's new.
