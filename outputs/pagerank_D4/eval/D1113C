Trading ivory was banned under the 1989 Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species to curb the slaughter of elephants in Africa.
Kenya and Mali are proposing an international ban on trade in ivory arguing that it was causing poaching of its elephants.
Because of this, the African elephant is classed as "vulnerable" and trade in ivory has been banned since 1989 to try to combat poaching.
"We have about 20,000 elephants in South Africa, more or less 14,000 in the Kruger National Park.
When a shipping container was seized in Singapore four years ago carrying more than SIX tons of elephant ivory inside, conservation and law enforcement agencies realized that they had intercepted the largest shipment of the contraband material since its international trade was banned in 1989.
Using DNA analysis, the group led by Wasser determined that the tusks came from African savannah elephants similar to those found in and around the nation of Zambia.
The United Nations treaty that banned international ivory sales in 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), allows limited sales of tusks harvested from animals that die naturally if the home government can demonstrate it is doing a good job of controlling poaching.
The seizure of the shipment from Malawi bound for the Far East was the largest since a 1989 international convention banning the ivory trade took effect and represented ivory from 3,000 to 6,500 elephants.
"We can conserve elephants but we have to start to worry about what we conserve with it," said Prof. Graham Kerley, an elephant expert who works with officials at Addo National Park, where the number of elephants is expected to double to about 900 by 2020.
The population growth of elephants is 6 to 7 percent," Van Schalkwyk said.
Mutsambiwa said recommendations of the SADC countries would be taken to the African Range of States a few weeks before the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conference to be held in June this year so that the continent would take a common position to the international conference.
One theory was that it came from Zambia and nearby Malawi, suggesting that elephant poaching in that part of Africa was more intense than recognized.
A DNA analysis by Samuel K. Wasser of the University of Washington and colleagues appears to have settled the issue.
Trade in ivory has been banned since 1989 to try to combat poaching despite appeals by South Africa to resume sales and invest the proceeds in its parks.
The report said the ban on international ivory sales was effective at first, in large part because wealthy nations provided funds to police game parks and go after poachers.
The comparison showed that the tusks seized from the black market came from elephants on Africa's broad savannas, primarily from a small area of southern Africa, most likely centered on Zambia, the researchers said.
The ivory, they report in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, most likely came from a narrow region across southern Africa centered on Zambia.
Much of the funding for the DNA analysis came from the U.S.
The price of ivory has nearly quadrupled in recent years, prompting poachers to kill more elephants to sell their tusks illegally.
Before the 1989 ban, most smuggled ivory was shipped to Europe, the United States and Japan.
But the seizure of more than six tons of ivory in Singapore in 2002 has helped solve part of that puzzle, according to a report by Samuel K. Wasser of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington in this week's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
``Right now, things are really much worse than before the ban,'' said Samuel Wasser of the University of Washington, lead author of the report funded jointly by the United States government and several nonprofit groups.

Then the boards are crushed, effectively breaking them down into metallic and nonmetallic particles.
The problem with circuit boards is that they are a complex sandwich of materials, mostly glass-reinforced resins and metals.
The metals can then be separated using conventional techniques, while the researchers experimented with turning the resinous particles into a kind of nonmetallic plate that they suggest could be used as insulating boards or other building materials.
"I would have preferred not to consider the options of both culling and contraception," he said.
Without that cull, the population would have rocketed by now to 80,000, according to park estimates.

"We can conserve elephants but we have to start to worry about what we conserve with it," said Prof. Graham Kerley, an elephant expert who works with officials at Addo National Park, which currently has some 450 elephants.
Botswana has by far the biggest elephant population, with an estimated 165,000 elephants, according to van Schalkwyk.
The West and East African nations argued that allowing any trade in ivory would increase elephant poaching.
The conference allows countries to amend rules aimed at defining and protecting endangered animal and plant species, including the 1989 ban on commercial ivory trade and some conditional, one-off sales allowed since then.
He said Zimbabwe did not want a repeat of the last CITES meeting when some African countries disowned the common position that had been agreed on.
They range from Tanzania's request to downgrade controls locally, to Kenya and Mali's joint proposal to maintain a complete ban on ivory trade for 20 years.
An international effort to halt the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks has all but collapsed in most of Africa, leaving officials and advocates alarmed about the survival of the species.
In its request, Zambia said 135 elephants had been illegally killed in the country in the past decade, but the researchers estimated that between 3,000 and 6,500 Zambian elephants had been killed for their tusks in the short period before the Singapore shipment.
Of the 270,000 elephants elsewhere in Africa, more than 23,000  nearly one in 10  were killed last year alone, the researchers estimated.
A team of US scientists has used DNA testing to identify the geographic origin of poached elephant tusks  research they hope may help curb the illegal ivory trade.
The tests revealed the ivory came from southern Africa, most likely Zambia.
The researchers used DNA testing to identify the geographic origin of 6.5 tons of contraband ivory seized in Singapore in June 2002.
The complex science of DNA analysis is now helping protect elephants by showing police and conservationists the source of black-market ivory.
The researchers analyzed genetic similarities between the tusks seized in 2002 and a reference database of elephant DNA samples created by Samuel Wasser, the lead author of the study, and his colleagues.
Kerley said their life expectancy made long-term planning essential.
On current trends the population of 17,000 is expected to reach 34,000 by 2020.
The South African National Parks recommended in 2005 that culling should be considered as one of the possibilities.
South Africa, Namibia and Botswana all have booming elephant populations, while East African nations such as Kenya are struggling.

He said Zimbabwe had an estimated 80,000 and Mozambique some 20,000.
The UN agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES, on Wednesday urged African states to overcome their deepening divide over a ban on the ivory trade and elephant conservation.
Zimbabwe's Parks and Wildlife Management Authority officials is preparing plans on how to deal with the proposal to ban international trade in ivory, the official New Ziana reported on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe is arguing that instead of banning the trade, countries should put in place adequate measures to prevent poaching of wildlife as it has done.
The authority director general Morris Mutsambiwa said they have already discussed responses to the proposal by Kenya and Mali to ban international trade in ivory.
The agency revealed that the mainly southern and eastern African nations in the elephants' range, as well as Mali, submitted conflicting proposals for the its triennial conference starting on June 3.
A study, to be released Tuesday, estimates that as many as 23,000 animals were slaughtered last year alone.
Wasser, a biologist at the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington, said elephants were being slaughtered at an unprecedented rate.
The study was funded primarily by the agency and the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
Wasser's report, published in the online version of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also described a unique effort to determine the origins of 532 unusually large tusks confiscated in Singapore in 2002.
The separation process uses a metal drum, too, that the mixed particles fall onto.
"There is a huge difference between what we had then and now," he said of the pre-1994 era.
Addo is regarded as a model in elephant management.
The government is fearful of upsetting tourists who flock to see the Big Five animals in Addo and the country's flagship Kruger National Park.
Environment Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk's announcement follows months of impassioned debate, with some conservationists arguing that overall biodiversity should take priority and animal welfare groups outraged at the prospect of slaughter.
Botswana and Namibia have submitted a joint proposal to maintain restricted sales in southern Africa while easing conditions for future sales.
Assuming only about 10 percent of contraband is detected, the actual amount of poached ivory was closer to 234,000 kilograms (514,800 pounds), or 23,000 elephants, about five percent of Africa's total population.
``Almost half of Africa's elephants had been slaughtered in the eight years before the ban, but now the situation is even more extreme because the number of animals is so much lower to begin with,'' he said.
He said the tusks could fetch thousands of dollars on the illegal ivory market.
Police in western Japan arrested two brothers on Wednesday for allegedly trying to import nearly three tons of ivory, a violation under the international ban on the trade in elephant tusks.
Kenya and Mali have proposed a complete ban on the overall trade in elephant tusks or finished ivory products for two decades for consideration at the conference in The Hague, CITES said.
According to the study's authors, more than 23,400 kilograms (51,480 pounds) of ivory was seized in the year ending in August 2006.
Ivory prices have skyrocketed, Wasser said, and the incentives for killing elephants for their tusks have never been higher.
Thieves in northeast Cambodia poisoned a domesticated elephant before sawing off its valuable tusks to sell on the black market, police said Tuesday.
They knew that the container had been shipped from South Africa, but they didn't know precisely where the ivory  532 tusks and more than 42,000 small cylinders called hankos  came from.

The 62-year-old bull elephant was found dead Saturday some 100 metres (yards) from its owner's home in Ratanakkiri province, police said, adding that it appeared to have been fed jack fruit laced with rat poison.
A single elephant devours up to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of grass, leaves and twigs a day.
A female normally breeds every four years and doesn't mate while nursing.
And they are messy eaters  60 percent gets wasted.
Only 30 elephants remain in Ratanakkiri, where the animals are a key means of transport for villagers.
"Elephants are majestic animals and are not trivial to the ecosystem.
Environmental groups and other interested parties have until May 4 to comment on the proposals and then after that it may take many more months to bring the measures into force.
In addition to work like theirs, they say, more outside aid needs to be provided for enforcement efforts in Zambia and elsewhere.
The Kenyan government has prepared a 62-page document that it will take to CITES justifying its proposals.
``And unlike in the late `80s, the public has forgotten about this issue.''
Already, the crowding is leading to tensions, according to Kerley.
With contraception, a female comes on heat every four months  but doesn't fall pregnant  and so suffers the physical stress of frequent copulation with bulls four times her weight.
Wasser said poaching poses a renewed threat to the survival of regional herds in many countries and to the entire subspecies of forest elephants, which he said is now being ``annihilated'' in central Africa.
They are a keystone species and taking them out significantly alters the habitat.
The females live to about 65 years old, but fighting among the bulls has reduced their average life span to 45 years  not long enough for them to grow the mighty tusks that are the trademark of other South African elephant populations.
"This demonstrates the divisions that still exist between African nations on the way forward for conservation of African elephants.
A single elephant devours up to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of grass, leaves and twigs a day.
Protecting the giant beasts is complicated by the fact they spread across large parts of Africa and authorities are unsure where the illegal hunting is occurring.

Authorities had suspected the confiscated ivory had multiple origins, the researchers said, but "our results caused law enforcement to substantially narrow the area of origin and the trade routes being investigated."
And they are messy eaters  60 percent gets wasted.
Because there are billions of circuit boards around and because some of the materials are valuable (including metals like copper and gold) and some toxic (including heavy metals and flame retardants), it can pay to keep them out of landfills or incinerators.
But methods of separating circuit board materials often involve heat or chemicals or both, and that can create additional environmental problems.
The nonmetallic particles remain on the drum as it rotates, eventually being scraped off so that they fall into another hopper.
It has ripple effects on lots of different species," he said.
In Addo, they feed on 146 different plant species  of which 75 are classed as rare, he said.
"This is the hard reality," he told a press conference overlooking a watering hole in Addo Elephant Park, where the elephant population is set to double by 2020  as is the population in Kruger.
"Although WWF does not advocate culling as the preferred management alternative, we recognize that it is a management option and reiterate our view that all other options should first be explored," said Rob Little, acting chief executive of WWF South Africa.
The report also said an education program in East Asia is essential to curb the demand for ivory.
"The government will never give a blank check to culling," Marthinus van Schalkwyk said, but stressed it had to take a more hands-on approach to controlling its elephants in order to preserve the delicate balance of nature in the flagship Kruger National Park and other wildlife reserves.
South Africa's environment minister on Wednesday proposed contraception and some culling  but no mass slaughter  as part of a package of measures to slow rampant elephant population growth.
But he said more sophisticated management options  like improving fencing and expanding parks  offered new alternatives.
Van Schalkwyk said the elephant management proposals included removing them to other areas, using water to influence their movements, creating special enclosures to protect other species, expansion of parks, contraception and culling.
But it has now become a victim of its own success and herds are growing at the rate of more than 5 percent a year and expected to double by 2020, threatening the delicate balance of nature.
"The feeding impact of elephants is enormous because of their large size and the way they feed," Kerley told a group of journalists visiting the park Tuesday ahead of van Schalkwyk's announcement.
The environment minister was due Wednesday to announce whether South Africa will resume culling elephants in a bid to slow the rampant population growth of the might beast.
A team of wildlife and law enforcement experts concluded that a widely hailed 1989 ban on international sales of ivory has been overwhelmed in the face of exploding demand for ivory in Japan and newly rich China and declining support for anti-poaching programs.
"This park is not about elephants and rhinoceros, it is about the full scale of diversity," said Kerley.
But, the researchers say not much progress has been made in the case, and there is more ivory smuggling now than at any time since the ban started.
Although it did not propose any immediate quota, Tanzania said some ivory trading would provide a "sustainable and valuable instrument of conservation," according to the UN agency.
Wasser and other authors, who include a member of Interpol and officials at African conservation programs, said an aggressive and well-funded anti-poaching program could be highly effective now because the DNA testing can pinpoint where the animals are being killed.
Meanwhile, Tanzania is recommending that its domestic elephant population be downgraded from the blanket protection afforded under a complete trade ban (CITES Appendix I), to more limited restrictions (Appendix II).
"We need an African position on this issue," said David Morgan, the head of CITES' scientific support unit.
Elephant populations rebounded substantially  especially in southern Africa  but as more exceptions to the ban were allowed and money to the fight poachers was cut back, illegal killings resumed.
"The problem is so serious that the giant creatures might be on the path to extinction unless Western nations reinstate strong enforcement that all but halted black-market ivory trade in the four years immediately after the (1989) ban was enacted," Wasser said.
"Resurgence of illicit trade in African elephant ivory is placing the elephant at renewed risk," the scientists said in a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Wasser and colleagues took samples of the confiscated ivory and compared it with baseline DNA collected from elephants across the continent over several years.
(The researchers sampled ivory from 37 tusks in the the hankos are still being analyzed.)
"These things are not springbok or locusts, you need a long-term solution," said Kerley.
"We dearly hope this indicates a long-term intention to ensure an ethical approach to elephant management," it said.
First, components like switches and capacitors (which can contain toxic metals) are stripped from the boards.
The nonmetallic particles pick up a static charge, while a stronger charge is induced in the metallic particles.
Both stick to the drum, but the metallic particles are immediately discharged to an electrode.
Although contraception is an alternative, it is also fraught with problems.
While the 1989 ban forbids all unapproved sales of ivory between nations, illegal material that slips through can become legal once it turns up in a new country.
These are separated using an electrostatic method, essentially the same technique that spreads toner across a rotating drum in a laser printer to produce a page.
In Addo, they feed on 146 different plant species, of which 75 are clased as rare, he said.
Overwhelmingly, what we have across Africa is a widespread slaughter of elephants that is getting worse by the day.''
South Africa has been hugely successful in managing its elephant populations, once on the verge of extinction in some parts of the country.
Conservation experts say there are signs that elephants are beginning to move from the Kruger into Mozambique, where populations are more sparse because of the long civil war, thanks to the removal of national fences in a new trans-frontier park.
Authorities have reintroduced the endangered black rhino into the park, where it lives in harmony with the elephant, but fear they could start competing for food.
Jia Li and colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have developed and tested an environmentally friendly recycling method that uses technology similar to what might be found in a laser printer.
Of the roughly 400,000 elephants in the African wild, he said, about 130,000 are in Botswana, where they are well protected to the point that they have overbred.
"The feeding impact of elephants is enormous because of their large size and the way they feed," Kerley told reporters who visited the park Tuesday.
The conference on June 3 to 15 is also due to re-examine a monitoring system to assess the impact of poaching, which Botswana, Namibia and South Africa were meant set up in return for being allowed one-off sales totalling 60 tonnes of ivory.
Police are investigating whether a large-scale smuggling ring was involved, the report said.
The estimate is based on the 5,600 pounds of ivory confiscated in a dozen international seizures in the year ended August 2006, and an assumption by law enforcement officials that they seize only 10 percent of all smuggled contraband.
The technique is described in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.
"Regulation of this trade could be vastly improved by the ability to verify the geographic origin of tusks," they said.
The arrest came as customs officials and police investigate 2,794 kilograms (3.07 U.S. tons) of ivory that was found in a cargo container last year at Osaka's South Port, said Toshiro Otsuka, an Osaka police official.
This was the largest amount of ivory ever seized in Japan, Kyodo News agency said.
The researchers in collaboration with Interpol, the International Police Organization, hope to use their findings and the database to concentrate efforts in the most active poaching regions of Africa.
The researchers identified China's burgeoning economy as a "major force driving the black-market ivory trade" and urged strong enforcement against poaching and education.
The tusk analysis allowed investigators to focus on one part of Africa rather than the whole continent, and prompted changes in the way Zambia deals with poachers.
The International Fund for Animal Welfare welcomed the promise by the minister to invest more into scientific research.
The World Wildlife Fund said it recognized the problem posed by elephant overpopulation in southern Africa and hailed the government's exhaustive consultations with conservation groups.
Recycling electronic devices isn't easy, and recycling the heart of a computer or other device  the printed circuit board  is among the most difficult tasks of all.
Without a charge, they fall off the drum into a hopper.
Addo  about an hour's drive from the southern coastal city of Port Elizabeth  is regarded as a model in elephant management.
The country culled a total of 14,562 elephants between 1967 and 1994.

In it, he said, a popular basketball player asks ``What's wrong with us that we kill the sharks for the fin?''
As a model, he proposed something similar to a current Chinese campaign against eating shark-fin soup.
The technique had been applied to ivory from individual elephants, but the new work uses statistical methods to apply it across a group.
Van Schalkwyk has said that the "no action" option is no longer realistic and that the government must act in the interest of "sustainable conservation."
"If international trade is killed, it will destroy jobs for traders and other downstream industries," said Mutsambiwa.
The United States and Britain are using some African countries to settle their political differences with Zimbabwe through sponsoring them to take positions and decisions that adversely affect the country's economy, Mutsambiwa added.
"We're hoping to organise a dialogue meeting for all the countries that hold African elephants before the conference, so that away from the spotlight they can find some sort of agreement," he added.
CITES found that the data was still not sufficiently complete last October and maintained its block on the one-off sales that had been agreed in principle five years ago.
``I don't think people in China and Japan fully understand the crisis that their ivory purchases have caused,'' Wasser said.
The seizure coincided with a request by the Zambian government for permission to sell tusks it had in storage.
No one had been arrested for the killing, Hor Ang said, adding the elephant's body had since been butchered for meat.
"The elephant's tusks, measuring between 70 to 80 centimeters (about 32 inches) long each, were sawed off," said deputy provincial police chief Hor Ang.
The two men were identified as the receivers of the cargo, Otsuka said, adding that officials are investigating the origin of the ivory shipment.
Now, the report found, most of it is going to China and Japan, although authorities say some is turning up again in the United States.
But many officials thought that ivory came from throughout sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting organized continentwide poaching and smuggling.
``But that's one small piece of the story.
Fish and Wildlife Service's African Elephant Conservation program, established by Congress in 1988.
Addo  which is about one hours drive from the southern coastal city of Port Elizabeth  was established as a national elephant park in 1931, after a sustained campaign by local hunters and farmers had decimated the herd to just 11 beasts.
Ivory is in demand for jewelry and, most commonly, for prized ``hankos'' used to stamp personal seals and signatures in parts of East Asia.
Although the population explosion is good news for the tourists who flock to the parks in the hope of spotting the Big Five  elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo  it is inflicting a heavy toll on vegetation and other animal species.
Park authorities are proud at their success in reintroducing the endangered black rhino into the park where it lives in harmony with the elephant, although fear that at some stage they will start competing for food.
With the acquisition of more land and extensive fencing to protect the animals from harm, the population has mushroomed.
Translocation  physical removal of the beast to a different area  is expensive.
In 1995 when we stopped culling we had around 8,000 elephants.
The announcement followed months of impassioned debate, with some conservationists arguing that overall biodiversity should take priority and animal welfare groups outraged at the prospect of slaughter.
Van Schalkwyk declined to predict how many elephants might die if culling does get the final green light.
"As long as Africa is divided, then the chances of success are not so high," he told journalists.
Each elephant has its own computerized file and a name and park officials can distinguish them even at a distance.
Wasser said reports of a rebound in elephant numbers had produced a distorted view of the situation.
``This is a very complex situation because people read these days about elephant overpopulation in places like Botswana, and how elephants are coming more and more into deadly contact with people,'' Wasser said.
Botswana is also independently seeking authorisation for additional one-off ivory sales of 40 tonnes.
Zimbabwe has invested heavily in protecting its wildlife resulting in the country becoming a prime tourist destination.
That gap is certainly something we in the secretariat feel needs to be bridged," Morgan said.
There is no regional consensus on the issue.
Compounding the problem, ivory smuggling has become increasingly the province of organized crime, with narcotics and other contraband often being shipped with the tusks.
The suspects' names are Hiroyuki and Daisuke Tada, said Osaka police official Seigo Yasui.
"Monitoring the origin of ivory passing through the major ivory markets around the world would greatly assist efforts to contain such trade."
