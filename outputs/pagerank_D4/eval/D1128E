Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will not be ready for the start of his trial in June on charges of overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in West Africa, his lawyer told a judge Friday.
The former warlord-turned-president has been indicted by the United Nations- backed Special Court for Sierra Leone on charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights.

Former Liberian President Charles Taylor was to appear in court Friday for a preliminary hearing ahead of his trial on charges of overseeing a campaign to terrorize Sierra Leoneans with a campaign of murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement.
Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to allegations that he armed and trained rebels responsible for a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in Sierra Leone's 10-year civil war.
Potential defense witnesses for Charles Taylor are refusing to testify at the former Liberian president's war crimes trial for fear of being slapped with U.N. travel bans, Taylor's lawyer told a court Monday.
The trial, which was moved to The Hague to the premises of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for security reasons is set to start in June and the defence is trying to get a more senior lawyer on board, Khan said.
The former Liberian leader will be tried in The Hague by a special chamber of the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, for security reasons.
Half the money needed this year for the court trying former Liberian President Charles Taylor on war crimes charges has been raised, the prosecutor in the case said Tuesday.
Friday's hearing at a court room in The Hague provided by the International Criminal Court was expected to assess progress by prosecution and defense lawyers in preparing for the trial.
The trial is expected to start June 4 in The Hague, Netherlands.
The defence of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, due to go on trial for war crimes here next month, said Monday that they needed more senior counsels for the complex case.
Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people during Sierra Leone's bloody 10-year civil war.
Taylor is charged with overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in neighboring Sierra Leone's 10-year civil war.
Judges have postponed testimony from witnesses at the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, due to start next month, to give defense attorneys more time to prepare.
In a pre-trial hearing of the case before the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his client was concerned he was being "short-changed" with only two attorneys who can attend his trial against a prosecution legal team of at least 10 people.
The family of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing charges of war crimes, said Friday that his lawyers have threatened to withdraw from the case, claiming a lack of time and resources.
He faces a total of 11 charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights and is specifically accused of aiding rebel groups which murdered, enslaved and mutilated civilians.

Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people in Sierra Leone.
He has pleaded innocent and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which is trying Taylor and other alleged human right violators in the civil war, has raised about half of its $33 million (euro25.44 million) budget for 2007, Rapp said.
The charges against Taylor stem from his alleged backing of Sierra Leonean rebels, who mutilated, raped and enslaved their victims.

The Sierra Leone requested that the case be moved to The Hague for fear the former warlord's trial could provoke unrest in West Africa.
Taylor did not to appear in the courtroom in The Hague provided by the International Criminal Court.
At Monday's hearing, slated to be the last before the trial starts next month, Khan also complained that the court was not funding an adequate defense team for Taylor.
Taylor goes on trial on June 4 at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Last week, Taylor's lawyers told the court they needed more time to prepare his defense.
Earlier this week, the Special Court for Sierra Leone set June 4 as the start date for Taylor's trial, which is expected to take up to a year to complete.
Members of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone arrived Wednesday in Liberia on a fact-finding mission ahead of the trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, facing war crimes charges in both countries.
The charges stem from Taylor's alleged arming and training of rebels in Sierra Leone during the later years of their insurgency.
Taylor's lawyers are seeking to appeal the decision setting the start date for the trial, arguing that they have not had enough time to prepare.
The Sierra Leone court usually sits in the capital, Freetown, but Taylor's trial is to be held in a courtroom rented from the International Criminal Court in The Hague because of fears the case could trigger new violence.
Taylor is accused of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone while he was leader of neighboring West African state Liberia.
Taylor, 59, is to go on trial June 4 on 11 charges, including terrorism, murder, rape, sexual slavery, mutilation and recruiting child soldiers linked to his alleged support for rebels in Sierra Leone's brutal civil war.
"I need more time to prepare," Taylor's British lawyer Karim Khan had told the hearing which Taylor himself did not attend because of a bad back.
The trial was expected to take up to a year.
The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the UN-backed court due to start in April, was moved out of Freetown and to the premises of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to avoid stirring unrest in strife-prone west Africa.
Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June and is being held in a cell block operated by the International Criminal Court.
He faces a life sentence if convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
Taylor has pleaded innocent to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity linked to the killing and mistreatment of thousands of people during Sierra Leone's bloody 10-year civil war, many hacked to death with machetes.
Rebels took up arms against him three years later, and he fled to Nigeria in 2003 at the end of Liberia's 14-year civil war.

Lead defense lawyer Karim Khan had asked for the trial to be postponed because consultations with his client were interrupted.
Taylor's lawyer, Karim Khan, said during Friday's 80-minute hearing that he would work toward the start date, but said, "we will not be ready" given the huge amount of prosecution evidence he has to study.
Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging his trial in Sierra Leone, where the Special Court usually sits, could trigger fresh unrest in the war-scarred African nation.

Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with his attorneys.
(The defence) just have to take out one element on each case, an essential element and they win an acquittal," the prosecutor explained.
The rebels also looted and torched homes, according to Taylor's indictment, which covers crimes allegedly committed between November, 1996 and January, 2002.

"The prosecution had five years, we had less than five months," she protested.
Khan also protested that prosecutors were not allowing him to distribute electronic copies of evidence to his client or other defense lawyers in Africa and requested that they release details of expert witnesses they plan to call in the case.
At a pretrial hearing in The Hague, Taylor's lawyer Karim Khan said his efforts to build a defense were being hampered by the perceived threat of U.N. sanctions.
Taylor's defense team had asked for the trial to start in September, saying it was unlikely to be ready before then because of the case's complexity, the amount of evidence turned over by prosecutors and lack of facilities for defense attorneys in The Hague.

Rapp said he expected the trial to begin June 4 as planned.
Taylor was flown to the Netherlands in June last year amid fears that staging the trial in Sierra Leone, where the Special Court usually sits, could trigger fresh unrest.
The trial of the ex-warlord, the biggest case before the International Criminal Court (ICC), has already been delayed once from April 2 until June 4 after a similar request, and this time the judge said no.
Khan said that former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had a much larger defense team when he went on trial for genocide at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
They also demanded more time to prepare their case, but were turned down.
Stephen Rapp, the prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), sought to reassure Liberians that Taylor would be judged fairly when he stands in the dock.
Taylor is seen as the single most powerful figure behind a series of civil wars in Liberia and neighbouring Sierra Leone between 1989 and 2003 which left around 400,000 people dead.

Prosecutors expect to call more than 100 witnesses, Rapp said.
"We believe that the defence has fully adequate resources to defend this case, the same level of resources as provided, if not greater than provided, by the other tribunals," prosecutor Stephen Rapp who will try Taylor's case told journalists.
The case, being heard in a courtroom rented from the International Criminal Court, is expected to last about 18 months.
He did not give details on the meetings, but said he was optimistic the court would raise enough money.
Judge Teresa Doherty made it clear, however, the trial's June 4 start date would not change.
In the Taylor case, there is enough money to "take us through the opening statement of the trial," Rapp said, adding that he was confident the rest of the money would come through.
They could vary depending on the number of witnesses needed, but are expected to decrease after the first year, he said.
According to Khan many witnesses are reluctant to testify because they are afraid of being slapped with a travel ban if they appear on his behalf during the trial.
On Monday the defence also complained they had difficulty getting witnesses to testify in the case because of a UN Security Council resolution that imposes travel bans on people deemed close associates of Taylor.
Defense attorneys are considering appealing, arguing that they still do not have enough time to prepare their case.
"The concern of my client is that he is being shortchanged," Khan said.
Khan said he would file a motion asking judges at the court to grant witnesses protection from sanctions.
In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that there were insufficient resources for the defence with just two attorneys versus some nine prosecution trial lawyers.
"We're confident that we can, as we continue the effort, obtain the resources needed to do this trial and to make it a model of international justice," Rapp said.
Taylor has two attorneys and three legal assistants, while prosecutors have a trial team of some 10 attorneys and lawyers.
His family complained that the prosecution currently has five senior counsels in its team while the defence has two lawyers with no proper offices both in The Hague and in Monrovia.
"Numerous individuals ... are unwilling to speak to the defense (because) they are petrified of having travel bans imposed upon them and having their assets frozen by the Security Council because they are associated to the defense of Mr. Charles Taylor," Khan said.
An April 25 ruling that was posted on the Special Court for Sierra Leone's Web site this week said Taylor's trial will begin as planned on June 4 but will be adjourned until June 25 after prosecutors deliver their opening statement.
Doherty ordered prosecutors to disclose details of their expert witnesses "as early as possible" but did not order any change in the way they shared information.
Rapp said he met last week with members of the U.S. Congress and the State Department, but was not sure if the United States would provide similar funding this year.
At the same time, Taylor was said to be in good health in his cell at The Hague where he mostly reads the Bible.
All efforts that are needed to be made have been made, are being made, and will be made to protect the security and identity of all prosecution witnesses."
Rapp stressed that the prosecution did have more resources that the defence because the prosecution "has the burden of proof to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt."
"It would be in the interests of a fair trial for him to be compensated for preparation time lost during that period."

Prosecutor Stephen Rapp said prosecutors fear that giving electronic versions of their evidence could allow confidential details to leak into the public.
She also ordered prosecutors to provide a document outlining their case by April 4.
"I must state in strong terms that one of our primary concerns is to see a fair trial carried out at the highest standards of international justice," Rapp said.
His attendance is not required at such preliminary hearings.
"That has compromised Mr. Taylor's ability to give instructions and freely discuss with his defence counsels and other individuals," the statement said.
"Mr. Taylor, through no fault of his own, has lost preparation time owing to the suspension of client-attorney consultations from 5-22 March 2007," said the ruling by the three-judge panel.
"Many civilians saw these crimes others returned to their homes or places of refuge to find the results of these crimes  dead bodies, savaged or mutilated victims and looted and burned property."

Taylor sat in court listening to proceedings wearing a dark suit and brown tie.
Dressed in a dark grey suit Taylor also wore sunglasses in court because he suffered from an eye infection, his lawyers said.
Judges also allowed him to wear sunglasses in the windowless courtroom because of an eye infection.
Expenses include transporting witnesses to The Hague, security, translations and hearings in Sierra Leone, Rapp said.
"Another concern is the well-being and safety of our witnesses.
He said that the possibility of sanctions, "would amount to witness intimidation, whether it comes from a group or a party or even as august a body ... as the Security Council of the United Nations.
"The lawyers argued that the time and resources available to them were so inadequate that it places them in a position of conflict with their professional obligation and renders the possibility of fair trial impossible", the family said in a statement sent to AFP.
Khan stopped meeting Taylor after authorities at the detention block installed video surveillance cameras in the room where the lawyers and Taylor discussed the case.
Prosecutors say that in exchange for diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone, Taylor provided rebels with arms, ammunition, communication equipment, as well as alcohol, drugs and cigarettes.
"The primary objective of the attacks was to terrorize the civilian population of Sierra Leone," prosecutors say in a summary of the allegations.

Taylor also launched a Liberian insurgency in 1989 and won elections that handed him the presidency in 1997.

Taylor was in court Monday listening attentively to the proceedings and making notes.
Rapp said met in New York with diplomats from Britain and the Netherlands, which have helped fund the court in the past, and other countries.
Last year, the U.S. provided $13 million (euro10.02 million) for the court.
U.S. officials did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
"The lawyers threaten to withdraw their services if the situation does not change", the statement said.
