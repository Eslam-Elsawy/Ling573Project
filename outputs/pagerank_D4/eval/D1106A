The conference brings together the world's regional tuna management groups and runs through Friday in the western city of Kobe.
International fisheries officials have agreed on an unprecedented action plan to reverse the decline in global tuna stocks, including a plan to track each fish from the ocean to the market, a news report said Thursday.
Representatives, including the commercial fishing industry, government regulators and environmental groups, plan to discuss ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to better manage tuna stock and adopt an action plan, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.
The conference, which ends Friday in the western city of Kobe, is the first by the world's five regional tuna regulating bodies to form a global strategy.
The tuna talks will for the first time bring together the five regional fishery management organizations, including the oversight bodies for tuna fishing in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.
It is proposed by Japan and organized by the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna agreed at a meeting in Miyazaki, Japan, to reduce the global catch of the endangered southern bluefin tuna by more than 20 percent in 2007.

The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.
The bodies are the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna.
The five bodies are expected to adopt an action plan to further harmonize their conservation and management measures for tuna stocks on the ending day, Kyodo News said.
Environmentalists called Monday for a radical overhaul of fishing practices to prevent a worldwide collapse in tuna stocks as international conservation bodies opened their first joint meeting on the species.
The meeting was the first to bring together the world's five tuna conservation bodies that cover different regions, including the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean.
The conference, which brings together the world's regional tuna management groups, is seen as a key step in combating the downturn in one of the most valuable and endangered high-seas fisheries.

"Atlantic bluefin, used for high-end sushi and sashimi, is massively overfished and the spawning stock of Southern bluefin in the Indian Ocean is down about 90 percent."
The plan was adopted in principle by the five international tuna conservation organizations at a first-of-its kind summit in the western city of Kobe, Kyodo News agency reported, citing unidentified conference officials.
The action plan is expected to address ways to share information among such regions to monitor tuna numbers and control illegal fishing vessels.
An international meeting aimed at saving global tuna populations from overfishing is set Friday to adopt a first-of-a-kind global action plan.
Issues such as sharing of information on illegal fishing vessels and studying stricter restrictions on purse seine fishing are among major topics of the Joint Meeting of Tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, the first ever such meeting.
The conference runs through Friday in the western port city of Kobe.

At that meeting, Japan also promised to halve its quota for the southern bluefin tuna as punishment for overfishing, but denied allegations it has poached thousands of tons of the endangered species every year.
Japan is the world's biggest tuna consumer, eating one quarter of the global catch.
This week scientists, regulators and fishermen are trying to reverse the decline at an unprecedented global summit to save the silvery fish and one of the world's most valuable and endangered catches.

"Sustainable management of the world's tuna fisheries should be possible, if the will can be found," he said in a statement.
"Japan is a major fishing nation and consumer of tuna, and we would like to take a leadership so that we can establish a system that allows us stable and sustainable management of the valuable resource," Sakamoto said.
Attendees, representing the commercial fishing industry as well as government regulators, will seek the creation of a framework requiring fishermen worldwide to produce certificates of origin for all species of tuna they catch, Kyodo News reported Sunday, citing a draft action plan for the meeting.
The plan calls for closer communication between the five global regulatory bodies, especially in sharing data on illegal fishing and tuna stock assessment, Kyodo said.
So far the five conservation bodies have lacked global standards on tuna-fishing.
The agency said participants are focusing on sustainable use of tuna resources.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, Japanese Fisheries Agency Director General Toshiro Shirasu warned that the tuna stocks have been overfished across the oceans, and he called on fishing industries across the world to tackle the problem with a global point of view.
Participants also seek to create a framework requiring fishermen worldwide to produce certificates of origin for all species of tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market, according to media reports.
The draft also calls for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market.
International fisheries officials are expected to push for a global tracking system that would certify the origin of every tuna headed to market at an unprecedented conference that convenes Monday to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches.
The discussions are also expected to focus on ways the regional groups can better share information.
Japan has also accepted a major cut in its quota for southern bluefin tuna in the Pacific Ocean as punishment for overfishing.

Nothing highlights Japan's insatiable hunger for tuna like the fish aisle at a supermarket  brick-size chucks of savory red meat, trays of delicately sliced sashimi and shelf-loads of sushi rolls.
In November, a study in the journal Science warned that if current trends of overfishing and pollution continue, the populations of just about all seafood face collapse by 2048.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's senior fishery statistician, Sachiko Tsuji, warned that the absence of a proper data collection system may hinder global efforts for the well use of tuna stocks.
But activists say overall quotas are still too high, and other challenges persist.
"Sustainable management of the world's tuna fisheries should be possible, if the will can be found," Simon Cripps, director of World Wildlife Fund's marine program, said in a statement Monday.
Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring fishermen  not just exporters  worldwide to produce certificates of origin for tuna they catch, and call for a monitoring system that would track the tuna catch from the open sea to the fish market, Sakamoto said.
Fisheries officials from around the world began discussing ways to reverse a sharp decline in tuna catches as a five-day conference kicked off Monday in Japan.

The country accounts for 12 percent of the global catch of 2.06 million tons and gobbles up about a quarter of the world's supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
"We are deeply concerned about the future of global tuna stock," Fisheries Agency chief Toshiro Shirasu said in opening remarks.
Participants are seeking to create a framework requiring fishermen  not just exporters  to produce certificates of origin for the tuna they catch.
The World Wildlife Fund, an environmental group which joined the meeting as an observer, warned in a statement that populations of important species such as bluefin tuna are "critically depleted " despite efforts by some governments.
"Tuna are fast disappearing, with important stocks at high risk of commercial extinction due to weak management," environmental group World Wide Fund For Nature said in a statement Monday.
Japanese Fisheries Agency official Takaaki Sakamoto said officials were still working on the draft action plan and couldn't comment on its content.
It would also assess efforts to combat illegal fishing and bycatch  the accidental catching of the fish.

An international commission in November reduced the world's gross catch of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean from 32,000 tons this year to 29,500 tons for 2007, a move likely to lead to an import crunch in Japan.
Concern has been growing about overfishing of tuna and other fish species.
"We have a general agreement on the action plan," a member of the Australian delegation said after the Thursday session.
But conservationists warn that poaching has expanded to capture live tuna for delivery to such farms, where they are fattened for market.
Tuna farms, for instance, are seen as one way of feeding global demand without depleting natural populations.
Overfishing and poaching are largely to blame for tumbling tuna stocks worldwide, conservationists say.
Overfishing and poaching are often cited as the cause.

The statement also expressed concerns about "the stock status of the world tuna resources being exploited close to, or over the level capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield".
Requiring certificates of origin for all tuna would expand the conservation programs already under way in some regions, which cover certain threatened species such as bluefin tuna, Kyodo reported, without saying how it got the draft or who wrote it.
"We must strengthen our cooperation to tackle the issue."
"We hope to accelerate cooperation as a result of this study," said Takaaki Suzuki, an official at Japan's fisheries ministry.
Doing so would help clamp down on excessive or illegal fishing, it said.
Overfishing and illegal fishing is often cited as the cause.
A global approach is seen as essential because tuna are highly migratory, journeying thousands of miles (kilometers) between feeding and spawning grounds.
The country accounts for 12 percent of the global catch of 2.06 million tons.
With soaring demand and prices to match, it's a small wonder that global tuna stocks are on the verge of collapse.
Experts also pointed out at the meeting that world demand for tuna has been on a rise since developing countries like China are adding the burden on global tuna stocks.
Governments "must acknowledge that a radical change to fisheries management is urgently required if they are to prevent the collapse of tuna stocks across the globe," it said.
Environmentalists called on participants to come up with substantive measures to protect the fish, which are highly prized in Japan.
The Tokyo-based Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries and the World Tuna Purse Seine Organisation, headquartered in Seoul, adopted a joint statement demanding a moratorium on the use of additional large tuna vessels, officials said.
Representatives of 60 countries or areas are taking part, officials said.

At the Kobe meetings, Australia, Japan and the United States have also proposed a unified performance review of the five global tuna organizations to figure out which conservation techniques work.
Some scientists believe that by 2030 there may be no mature tuna left among species like the southern bluefin if overfishing and poaching aren't addressed.
Prized bluefin specimens the size of grown men, hooked as far away as the Mediterranean, are packed in ice and flown for next-day delivery to Tokyo, where they can fetch hundreds of dollars per pound (hundreds of euros per kilogram) at auction.
"I'd be very disappointed if we will not adopt it tomorrow."
The recommendations echo those of the World Wildlife Fund, which released a position statement before the meeting calling for a "global catch identification system," according to the Australian Associated Press.
"But many governments are routinely ignoring scientific advice, failing to implement the available conservation and management measures."
The plan also recommends establishing an international high seas inspection team.
Under the plan, the groups will clamp down on poaching by harmonizing a trade tracking program that will improve documentation of the world's catch through electronic tagging, Kyodo said.
She said the failure to have a correct judgment of the scale of overfishing and the lack of an appropriate systems to collect various data, including those on port, trade and market controls, could lead to management failure.
That should help crack down on illegal fishing and countries that exceed quotas.
Japan's fisheries agency says the country gobbles up a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
At stake is an annual global haul worth hundreds of millions of dollars (euros) and the preservation of a top-tier predator fish that helps hold the ocean ecosystem in balance.
Overfishing on one side of an ocean can affect fisheries half a world away.
The new question is how long  or if  the binge can continue.
Simon Cripps, director of the WWF's global marine programme, said the talks in Japan "provide an opportunity for all interested nations to adopt approaches that ensure good practices to protect tuna, other marine life and the well-being of coastal communities."
"Some stocks are not in danger, others are."
"It would be much more efficient to establish a universal framework for tuna management."
He said scientific advice to governments about conservation measures has gone ignored for too long.
Greenpeace said it was "high time" for governments to recognize the seriousness of the tuna issue.
