Like Nedimyer, they are trying to identify strains of coral that grow well in the Keys, and to re-establish them offshore.
"If we can't grow them outside of the coral reef, you're not going to get them."
The reefs are rich in coral species and home to up to 1,000 species of fish.
Under the U.S. proposal up for debate at the CITES meeting, trade in several species of corallium would be regulated for the first time to ensure harvesting and global sales do not threaten their survival.
He is working with assistance from the conservancy, which in turn cooperates with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which has its own coral efforts in places like Puerto Rico.
All 26 species in the Corallium genus will now be protected by the 171-nation Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which regulates the world trade in wildlife.
This project has its roots in a conversation about the state's coral that Berzins had with Craig Watson from the Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin, and an official from the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
"Coral reefs support some of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world.
Red coral, also known by its Latin name corallium, is a slow-growing deep-sea coral that grows all over the world but is harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Pacific.
The United Nations agency regulating the trade in endangered species, CITES, unveiled some 40 new government proposals for changes to wildlife trade rules which will be considered at the organisation's conference in June.
In 2000, at an aquarium in Orlando, he heard a presentation on Pacific coral and learned that "you can cut these things into tiny fragments and glue them to things and they will grow."
Great star coral, or Montastrea cavernosa, at the University of Florida Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin is being raised in an effort to restore reefs in the Florida Keys.
But two species of coral last year were listed as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act.
The scientists noted that in some well-managed, protected areas of the ocean, human impacts are reduced, allowing most corals to thrive.
Some of the tiny corals from the Keys came to the aquarium.
The global wildlife trade watchdog agreed Wednesday to regulate sales of red coral, which conservationists say is under threat from overfishing for the jewelry industry.
Delegates at the triennial meeting of the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species put the coral on a list of protected wildlife, meaning exporters will now have to prove that the coral was harvested without threatening the species' survival before they can sell it.
But the ones most often exploited to make jewelry and art objects are red and pink coral, found throughout the world's tropical and temperate seas but harvested mainly in the Mediterranean and Western Pacific.
The idea is to grow coral in labs, kind of like fish farms, so they can be returned to their natural settings in Florida's struggling coral reefs.
The scientists have nursed dozens of tiny coral fragments in a lab in Ruskin, and transported them to Western Sambo Reef in the Keys.
Others went to Hillsborough County, to the Tropical Aquaculture Lab in Ruskin.
But a major goal of the tourism partnership is supporting sustainable community use of the reef area, which includes providing alternative livelihoods to destructive fishing.
"We will not use this precious material in our jewelry until harvesting methods have been adopted that ensure the sustainability of coral reefs," she told Sea Web, an ocean conservation group that works with the international jeweler.
He had permission from the government to gather live rock at a particular site and one day about 10 years ago, he noticed that a few bits of rubble had something growing on them.
They developed a plan: Take some tiny bits of coral from a construction site in the Keys.
When he found broken pieces of coral he stuck them in other pieces of rock, and "sometimes they would live."
"If we can't come up with answers to our environmental problems," she said, "we're not being good stewards."
That's mostly one person making a difference."
A finished necklace of red coral retails for up to 20,000 dollars (15,000 euros), making the sea animal one of the world's most expensive wildlife commodities.
They cut the corals with a tile saw, and used epoxy to glue them onto small concrete disks.
"If restoration of coral reefs is going to occur, you need corals," Watson said of the aquaculture lab.
Komodo is now run by a nonprofit joint venture between the Nature Conservancy and a local tourism company.
Areas being addressed include the creation of a dedicated snorkeling zone in Cozumel to limit visitor impact to one section of the reef, and ensuring that park management fees are collected and put toward protection and management of marine areas.
He had just returned to the boat after scuba diving off Fort Lauderdale, where he viewed elkhorn and staghorn coral, recently listed as endangered species.
The contribution of conservation fees to support the protected areas, which many businesses have long resisted, is also important.
The UN wildlife trade organisation imposed strict limits Wednesday on the global trade of pink and red coral, severely depleted by commercial exploitation.
"We have lost 25 percent of the world's corals in the last 25 years," David E. Vaughan, director of the Center for Coral Reef Research at Mote, said in an interview, adding that 25 percent more are expected to die in the next decade or two.
The trade in the slow-growing, deep sea coral is now so widespread that there are fears for its survival.
Some of his corals are doing so well they have even spawned in the tanks.
"We are not an this is our tradition, our culture.
"We are not an this is our tradition, our culture.
"Until now most species of Corallium have been over-harvested as a result of a free-for-all situation."
Today he has several nurseries, each with a variety of coral strains, at varying depth, water quality and distance from shore.
And as oceans warm, algae that live in corals, and on which they depend, may be killed.
"I didn't know what it was at first," he said.
The United States is leading a push to have the coral, whose scientific name is corallium, protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a global conservation body meeting until June 15 in The Hague.
The requests also include an attempt by the United States to control the trade in pink coral for the first time, because of the overexploitation of tropical coral reefs which have been rendered fragile and bleached by climate change.
"It takes a long, long time to grow these coral reefs and in a very short period of time, we can destroy them if we're not careful."
On Wednesday the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) had placed 26 species in the Corallium genus on its Appendix II, protecting them from the unregulated trade which has decimated coral stocks around the world.
Like Nedimyer, he is starting corals on concrete disks and establishing them in the water, in his case between Looe Key and American Shoals, near the laboratory.
They experimented with growing platforms and especially with how to glue coral fragments to them.
At Mote, Lackland maintains and propagates a variety of coral species in tanks, and hopes to emulate Nedimyer with offshore nurseries between Looe Key and American Shoals.
Vesuvius volcano on Italy's Mediterranean coast, who have harvested the coral for generations and turned it into art works and jewelry.
I kept watching them and pretty soon they started to grow out into staghorn coral."
Study the coral in a lab, watch it grow, make sure it's healthy.
But pollution, warming waters from climate change, commercial fishing, development and ship groundings are jeopardizing them.
This University of Florida lab works closely with the tropical fish industry, which has a large presence in Tampa Bay.
That's because she also is a veterinarian.
There is special emphasis on the Riviera Maya of Mexico, where, less than nine miles offshore, the island of Cozumel is the world's second most-visited cruise destination after Miami, according to the International Council of Cruise Lines.
The Nature Conservancy's Coral Triangle Center works at several sites in Indonesia, including the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua and Komodo National Park, a major protected marine area in the Lesser Sunda Islands.
It includes eco-certification programs for tourism operators within the boundaries of the marine park, environmental tourist fees, large no-take zones, species monitoring, and tourism industry contributions to the Great Barrier Reef's main research center.
In 2004, the nonprofit group Conservation International began a program called the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative, which aims to address the threat that mass tourism poses to the Mesoamerican Reef by engaging hoteliers, developers, cruise lines, and local governments in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.
Growing awareness of environmental issues means that the tourism industry has lately been a partner to conservation efforts in major reef areas.
According to the Nature Conservancy, the annual economic value of coral reefs to world tourism is $9.6 billion.
Last year, as part of the Mesoamerican Reef initiative's efforts, the cruise line council began an effort to avoid wastewater discharge by cruise ships in environmentally sensitive areas.
To keep coral reefs from disappearing as quickly as they have in recent years, people need to be involved and educated on every level from local government to hotel developers to cruise lines, said Sweeting of Conservation International.
Several major retailers have supported the new restrictions.
It is not sunken treasure or a Spanish galleon, but rather nature's bounty: rows of coral reefs that generate billions of dollars a year in tourism spending.
"In another year or two we'll have several thousand corals.
Kramer, Johnson and Nedimyer were pleased by the corals they saw at the nursery.
Each one held a tiny piece of coral.
"Until we are convinced that coral harvesting is sustainable and does not threaten marine ecosystems, we believe this cautionary principle should continue to apply," the company says on its Web site.
But then, he said, he started thinking about what had happened to the Keys' reefs since he first encountered them in the 1970s, "when there would be thickets three, four, five feet high and just vast."
Scientists do not know for sure what causes the condition, and their suspects  bacteria, fungi and other microbes  are present at healthy corals as well as sickly formations, adding to the mystery.
They have tiny mouths that they can open to swallow plankton, and also get nourishment from algae in the surrounding water.
Different kinds of corals have different kinds of algae symbionts, but if the algae are threatened, corals are threatened, too.
Now, many in the tourist industry are trying to halt the damage.
Many would say corals globally are already so damaged, and so threatened by further environmental degradation, that there is little chance restoration efforts can turn things around.
Italian craftsmen from the town of Torre Del Greco near Naples had lobbied against CITES regulating the trade, saying that they had been harvesting it in a sustainable way for 800 years and would continue to do so to preserve their livelihoods.
They are suffering the kinds of environmental disruption that afflict corals around the world.
"We're afraid that if things continue the way they are it could lead to species being depleted from large areas," said Bruckner.
But the world's second-largest barrier reef, the Mesoamerican Reef in the Caribbean, is seriously endangered by coastal development, runoff, and pollution.
But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs  which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems  are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities  including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.
The acidity makes it more difficult for corals to grow and may even cause them to start to dissolve.
Everyone in the project stressed that growing coral in "farms" and placing it in the wild is a complicated process that may take years to accomplish and study.
Like Nedimyer, Lackland, who is 40, parlayed a youthful fascination with marine creatures  he had corals in tanks in his bedroom as a teenager in Watchung, N.J.  into his life's work.
His daughter Kelly helped, turning the work into a 4-H project.
"We tried a lot of epoxy," Nedimyer said.
Scientists from the University of South Florida, Florida Atlantic University and Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota have assisted in the research.
And 90 miles south on Highway 1, the traffic-snarled spine of the Keys, biologists at the Mote Marine Laboratory struggle with their own coral nursery efforts.
Fishing boats, and even dive boats and divers, can damage reefs.
"After a decade supporting conservation in Komodo National Park, the Nature Conservancy recognized the need for self-sufficiency," said Marcus Matthews-Sawyer, director of tourism communications for the joint venture.
Though Komodo is one of Indonesia's greatest tourism assets  it is one of the most frequently visited nature reserves in the country  conservation work there is also necessary to protect young fish that are a source for surrounding fishing grounds.
The collection of conservation fees from tourists, about $15 a stay, is vital to sustaining park management.
In the Mediterranean, trawl fishing has been replaced by scuba divers harvesting the coral and some countries have imposed quotas and minimum size limits.
The dollars involved in reef-based tourism are significant: Australia's Great Barrier Reef alone draws about 1.9 million visitors a year, supporting a $4.2 billion industry.
"This program will ensure that cruise line wastewater is discharged at least four miles from any of the sensitive marine ecosystems within the Mesoamerican Reef system, thereby minimizing the chance such discharges will have negative impact on the long-term health of the reef," said Jamie Sweeting, who oversees Conservation International's work with the travel industry.
About two and a half miles out, he told Johnson to throttle back a bit.
In some parts of the world, corallium is still harvested using trawl nets dragged along the seabed  a practice that devastates the coral.
"Our ocean resources pump billions of dollars into our economy."
Reef-related activities generate more than $4 billion (euro3 billion) for the economy of southeast Florida alone, Dodge said.
Corals need herbivorous fish to keep unwanted algae under control.
"People are just now starting to appreciate the value of reefs," Keeney said.
The goal of the project is to identify which coral strains are most robust and in what conditions.
It didn't work, and now the tires are scouring the ocean floor and wedging against the natural reef, killing coral.
"But nature will not let you get away with it."
Pink coral, cedar trees, types of fish eaten in Europe and a cuddly, wide-eyed mammal that is prized in Asian medicine are among the animal and plant species that could gain greater protection this year, a UN agency said Wednesday.
When seaweed-eating fish are gone, "you are going to end up with seaweed blooms," said Nancy Knowlton, director of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a leader in the World Bank effort.
Ilze Berzins of the Florida Aquarium, who is in charge of the effort, said it's more than an interesting scientific pursuit.
Back in the Keys, he started experimenting.
But destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced worldwide catches by 90 percent in the past two decades, scientists say.
"So I thought, well, these corals are in trouble.
He set the rocks aside, underwater, and managed to keep the coral growing in spite of storms and other problems.
Scientists want to protect the coral to save the surrounding environment.
Another serious disruption is overfishing.
"Red coral is the most valuable and widely traded out of all the coral species, and CITES protection will help ensure the future of the species and the red coral industry," he said.
The pink variety of the polyp has been prized in jewellery and for decoration for 5,000 years.
Reauthorization of the act would create that authority and also build a federal fund to restore damaged reef systems, he said.
All three reef systems  the Great Barrier Reef, the Mesoamerican Reef and the Coral Triangle  are jeopardized by the threat of global warming, which kills coral and leads to a bleaching effect.
They monitored the different species of brain coral, boulder coral and others.
"One of the Atlantic Ocean's most beautiful marine habitats no longer exists in many places because of dramatic increases in coral diseases, mostly caused by climate change and warmer waters," said Dr Michael Smith, director of the Caribbean Biodiversity Initiative at Conservation International.
Part of the reason the coral is so vulnerable is that it grows so slowly  in some cases just 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches) or less per year  takes up to seven years to reach maturity and has low reproduction rates.
After obtaining government grants, she and colleagues studied the coral and developed health certificates for the tiny animals a way of determining whether they were healthy enough to be put back in the wild.
But, she said, corals that grow quickly are often unusually sensitive to their environment.
Nedimyer focuses most of his efforts on coral, something he got into almost by accident several years ago, through his work as a wholesale dealer in aquarium supplies, a business he has operated for 35 years.
For a brief heady moment, he recalled, he thought about the fact that he has government permission to sell coral and considered turning it into a lucrative sideline for his business.
With a finished necklace retailing for up to 20,000 dollars (15,000 euros), red corals are among the world's most expensive wildlife commodities.
But one of its major rewards, he said, was its lesson for his daughter Kelly, now 19 and a student at the University of Central Florida, and the Coral Shores students working with him.
It's all part of a complicated experiment to find a new way to save Florida's vast coral reefs, which lately have been dying from everything from shipwrecks to pollution to climate change.
"The first thing you think when you see it is these things don't belong here.
Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram at auction and finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can cost anywhere from US$20 (euro15) to US$20,000 (euro15,000) depending on their size and quality.
Raw coral can sell for US$900 (euro670) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) at auction and finished works of art or pieces of jewelry can cost anywhere from US$20 (euro15) to US$20,000 (euro15,000) depending on their size and quality.
He presented himself at the National Marine Sanctuary, where he learned there might be an opening for a biologist at Mote.
Scott Graves, hatchery manager at Tropical Aquaculture Laboratory in Ruskin, holds a fragment of Knobby brain coral, or Diploria clivosa.
Andy Bruckner of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who drafted the U.S. proposal adopted at the conference, welcomed its acceptance.
"It's been shown that seaweeds release a lot of sugars into the water," she said.
Because of all the dangers facing Florida's coral reefs today, she said, doing something to restore them is urgently needed.
Because many bacteria need sugars, "you have these bacteria blooms that kill corals."
The boat pulled up to the site and Philip Kramer, who directs the conservancy's Caribbean Marine Program, set its anchor.
It usually progresses quickly, and while it almost never wipes out complete colonies, colonies can be reinfected.
The cruise industry is a particular area of concern, since ships regularly disgorge crowds of passengers into fragile coastal areas that strain to absorb the impact.
Meanwhile, a host of diseases plague coral, many of them poorly understood.
"Over there," he said, pointing off the starboard bow.
Conservation International estimates that cruise passengers typically make about 2,000 scuba dives in and around Cozumel's surrounding reefs in a single day.
The port has three reefs off its shore and narrow channels and tight spots for maneuvering and anchoring among them.
The World Bank, motivated in large part by corals' importance for ecosystems and ecotourism, has embarked on a global program to assess restoration efforts and to identify tactics to combat their decline.
One of them, Ken Nedimyer, stood next to her at the console, gazing out at the seemingly featureless welter of waves, seeking signs  a slight change in water depth here, a barely visible underwater patch of reef there  that only he could recognize and triangulate with the rapidly disappearing onshore landmarks of Key Largo.
For example, Bunaken National Park, in north Sulawesi, is today managed in large part by a local association of dive operators who saw the declining quality of coral (and their livelihood) in the mid-1990s.
Blast fishing  using explosives to stun or kill fish  is now prohibited within the park.
A gathering of 23 scientists in March 2007 analyzed data on tropical corals, seagrasses, mangroves and algae  all fundamental components of healthy marine ecosystems.
That's impressive," said Michael Sole, Florida's environmental chief, who joined Keeney.
"Sometimes we sound like doomsday sayers," Vaughan said, "but those are the facts."
Clouds were moving across the sun and a 20-knot northeast wind was stirring a 3-foot chop as Meaghan Johnson headed her open boat into the Florida Straits.
As Thursday's trip neared its end, Keeney peered out over the glistening, emerald green ocean and pointed to a pod of dolphins bobbing along a reef.
Johnson, a program coordinator for the Nature Conservancy, headed the boat into the swells, to minimize swamping, as her passengers tried in vain to avoid soaking spray.
The Coral Reef Task Force, created in the Clinton administration, regularly assesses coral health.
But it is now making a comeback, increasing pressure on stocks.
And it is white, which looks nice against the sandy bottom.
This image is a macro photograph, capturing an area about 11/4 inches across, of a cluster of individual coral polyps, or animals.
The agency said many of the proposals reflected growing international concern about the accelerating destruction of the world's marine and forest resources through overfishing and excessive logging.
Degrading them could put coastal communities at risk.
"We are pleased that the international community has recognized the threats corallium face, and is taking the necessary steps to safeguard these species."
Lackland has devised elaborate systems to mimic the flow of ocean currents, the varying pressure of waves and even the coming and going of daylight.
But her shelves also contain books with titles such as Goat Medicine and Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine.
Potentially the most endearing candidate for a complete ban trade is the Slow Loris, a small furry nocturnal primate from south and southeast Asia.
The 142-foot ship was 5 miles off Key West, carrying 20 tons cargo of candy and cigarettes, and straining against what later would be called the no-name storm.
In interviews, Lackland and Nedimyer separately acknowledged that viewed from any reasonable perspective, the problem is huge and their efforts are small.
"We found kinds that stick to wetsuits, to hair, to cameras."
She said people interested in corals should focus on "fixing the things we can fix  climate action or water quality action or stopping overfishing."
Cambodia, which is sponsoring full protection under CITES Appendix I, says the Loris is threatened by a combination of the destruction of its forest habitat and growing demand for traditional medicine and as a pet.
The reef system stretches nearly 700 miles from the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico to the Bay Islands of Honduras.
"It took Cancun 35 years to develop to this massive size, and it took less than a decade for the Riviera Maya," he said.
Crucial partnerships between conservation groups and the tourism industry have also taken root in the Coral Triangle.
For example, staghorn and elkhorn coral are vulnerable to so-called white-band disease, in which coral tissue mysteriously decays.
"We're working with the municipal government, the local dive and water sports association, and the cruise lines themselves, because they all have a vested interest to look after this coral reef," Sweeting said.
There have been 12 major ship groundings on reefs outside Port Everglades, just south of Fort Lauderdale, since 1993.
Staghorn and elkhorn corals, Nedimyer's principal interests, were once abundant in South Florida, the Bahamas and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
Florida is also spending $2 million (euro1.5 million) to remove some 700,000 old tires from the ocean floor off Fort Lauderdale that were dumped there in the 1970s with the intent of creating an artificial reef.
"They support people's incomes and livelihoods."
In the Mediterranean, it is gathered by scuba divers but in some other parts of the world fishermen still use trawl nets dragged along the seabed  a practice that devastates the coral.
The UN wildlife trade organisation back-tracked Friday and removed restrictions it had imposed days earlier on the global trade in coral species severely depleted by commercial exploitation.
It's a wasteland," Keeney said after surveying the tires.
But since the 1990s they have significantly declined, to the point that last year they were placed on the threatened list, under the Endangered Species Act.
"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in these corals under some form of international control," said Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from wildlife monitoring network TRAFFIC.
"This is the best possible decision to start getting the trade in these corals under some form of international control," said Ernie Cooper, a coral trade expert from TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network.
"It doesn't allow us to go into areas outside protected areas and hold parties responsible for the damage," Keeney said.
The EU also wants the trade in the European eels, a popular food in coastal areas of northern Europe, and the spiny dogfish, a type of shark prized in fish and chip shops, to be subject to a permit system and fisheries management, CITES said.
Destructive fishing methods and over-harvesting have reduced worldwide catches by 90 percent in the past two decades, scientists say.
Stocks off the coasts of Spain, Italy and France have already been commercially depleted, experts say.
Like miniature forests of richly colored trees, red coral decorates pockets of the world's seas and oceans from the Mediterranean to the Pacific.
Environmental disruption takes many forms.
One place you can no longer buy corallium jewelry is a Tiffany and Co. store.
Knowlton, the coral expert at Scripps, said staghorn coral was among the fastest growing  up to four inches or so from branch tips in a year, whereas most corals grow only about half an inch a year.
Soon he, Johnson and Nedimyer were over the side, peering into the water through their snorkeling masks.
He added, "Over these geological time scales, in the long term, corals may be able to handle these climate changes."
Nedimyer shares this view even though, as he put it, every day he spends on the project "is one day I can't make a living."
Scientists at the Hillsborough lab went to work with equipment similar to what you might get from Lowe's or Home Depot.
Caribbean coral species essential to the region's reef ecosystems are at risk of extinction as a result of climate change, according to a new marine life study released Thursday.
"They can slip from growing really fast to dying really fast," she said.
Under current law, the federal government has no authority to fine boats or ships for running aground on coral reefs that are not located within marine sanctuaries or to penalize people who destroy them, he said.
Below them was what they had come to see, an array of concrete disks set in the sand.
And we can make a difference rather than make money."
"The biggest problem is making a difference on a regional scale or even on a large local scale."
And then find a way to return it to the wild in hopes that it will flourish.
It is also rare because it grows so slowly  in some cases just 1.5 millimeters (0.06 inches) or less per year  takes up to seven years to reach maturity and has low reproduction rates.
"We have turned five corals into five to seven hundred," he said.
In December, scientists went to Western Sambo Reef and used more epoxy to glue the disks in place.
Eventually, they discovered a two-part epoxy glue used in taxidermy.
"It is like clear-cutting a forest  it pulls everything up, there's a lot of loss and you remove the large colonies, the small colonies and cause a lot of damage to the habitat," said Andy Bruckner of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
On Thursday, Tim Keeney, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary for oceans and atmosphere and a key high-level figure within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, got a firsthand look at reef damage and repair and recovery efforts.
That affects not just the coral but also other marine wildlife that use coral colonies as a place to feed, mate and hide from predators.
Reefs are not only a big attraction for divers and tourists, but they also are the backbone of an ecosystem that supports a wide diversity of fish and other undersea life.
Sea turtles bang into corals, breaking them.
They can mix it on a boat and it remains workable for about half an hour.
The joint venture, PT Putri Naga Komodo, was established in 2005.
The partnership plans to have Komodo self-financed by park fees by 2012.
Though the Great Barrier is the most famous reef, it is not the most its extensive marine management program is widely regarded as a model for conservation.
Tourism has helped raise awareness of the destination and of the reefs' biological importance.
And reefs in the Coral Triangle in Southeast Asia  which reaches from Malaysia to the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands, encompassing some of the planet's most diverse marine habitats  have been severely damaged by overfishing and destructive practices, including the use of cyanide and dynamite to capture fish.
In aquariums, the bacteria help break down waste from fish.
Several large freighters passed by in the distance, heading toward Port Everglades.
In developing nations like Indonesia, where human and financial resources are slim, the cooperation of private tourism businesses has been instrumental in accomplishing reef conservation goals.
The state is managing underwater nurseries to grow coral that will be transplanted onto natural reefs, seeking to end the pumping of treated wastewater into the ocean and plowing ahead with research into artificial reefs.
Scientists warn that up to half of the world's coral reefs could disappear by 2045.
Kramer noted that, overall, "corals have managed to deal with many swift changes in the last million and half years."
But, he added, "If the ocean is really in that bad condition, let's gear up!"
"I like the challenge," said Ryan Czaja of the aquarium, who dives to place and inspect the coral.
Its value is boosted by its rarity and the fact that it is hard to gather because it grows as deep as 1,000 meters (3,280 feet).
Urchins graze on unwanted algae, and without them, corals in many areas have been smothered in overgrowth, making it difficult or impossible for them to grow or propagate.
So far, scientists say, it has had two main effects on coral, both potentially lethal.
"I am not an ostrich," Lackland said.
"The science was clear on this issue and not debated  this is a political decision," she said.
For scientists like Knowlton, the major question is not whether some coral strains might do better than others.
Germany, which currently holds the European Union presidency, said the spiny dogfish was vulnerable because of its tendency to travel in large schools that are easily trawled by fishing boats and its slow reproductive rate.
Those kinds of underwater landscapes have just about vanished, he said.
"We believe that coral harvesting as currently practiced is not sustainable and threatens marine ecosystems," said Fernanda Kellogg, senior vice president of Tiffany and Co.
One of his products is "live rock," reef rubble that bacteria colonize.
Other fish species up for protection due to overexploitation include Brazilian lobsters, while several countries want complete halt in trade in the sawfish, a favourite for traditional medicine.
"We started 800 years ago and we want to continue," said Ciro Condito of Assocoral, a lobby group representing the craftsmen.
After climbing back into the boat, Nedimyer said: "They were a few inches, now they are two or three times the size.
Fourteen years later, scientists from the Florida Aquarium in Tampa are still trying to repair the damage caused that night not to the freighter, but to the delicate coral reef it smashed into.
So to save the crew, he ran the ship aground.
The U.S. proposal will be debated and put to a vote next week.
The report by Conservation International found 10 percent of the Caribbean's 62 spectacular reef-building corals  one of the sea's most spectacular natural resources  are under threat and candidates for "critically endangered" designations.
Polluted runoff can deprive corals of the clear, oxygen-rich water they need to survive.
Coral are animals related to sea anemones and jellyfish, whose skeletons can form rocklike structures that make up reefs.
It also adorns the necks and arms of the rich and fashion conscious.
"Biological diversity faces many threats, ranging from habitat destruction to climate change to unrestrained commercial harvesting for trade," said Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, which administers CITES.
A popular item in home aquariums, the striking tropical Bangai cardinal fish, is also a candidate for listing, because about 700,000 to 900,000 of them are collected every year.
"We're talking about a major economic engine that people don't understand," said Richard Dodge, executive director of the National Coral Reef Institute.
"Taking appropriate measures to improve our understanding is key because you can't manage what you don't understand," Sole said.
States and counties currently have limited authority.
That's a lot of growth in six months."
Corals also need predators like groupers, snappers, barracudas and even lobsters to prevent the proliferation of coral-eating snails, worms and other organisms.
Green sea turtles, cascades of glittering reef fish, blooming coral pillars  countless travelers have come nose to nose with a thriving undersea universe while on vacation.
Founded in 1980, the park is a World Heritage Site and protects the habitat of the Komodo dragon, as well as important whale migration routes between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
The ban is credited with a 60 percent increase in hard coral coverage between 1996 and 2002, according to the Coral Triangle Center.
And while tourism cannot solve the problem of rising sea temperatures, the industry's cooperation to eliminate specific pressures  by establishing a well-enforced no-take zone, or reducing wastewater pollution, for example  helps reefs recover from bleaching and disease.
The group has launched a campaign, "Too Precious to Wear," aimed at raising awareness of the coral's vulnerability.
Enforcement of the park zoning system, which restricts access to certain parts of the reefs, continues to be a challenge because of limited resources.
The disease, which struck the Caribbean in the mid-1990s, kills healthy tissue, leaving only white skeletons.
The Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative has also begun a program to evaluate and implement good business practices for conserving water and energy, reducing solid waste, and managing chemicals at coastal hotels along the Riviera Maya and in southern Belize.
When the coral reefs disappear, so will many other species which rely on reefs for shelter, reproduction and foraging," said Dr Suzanne Livingstone, another marine biologist who contributed to the study.
Friends told him he had "a blue thumb."
Corals in South Florida have another big problem, a die-off of sea urchins, which began succumbing wholesale to a mysterious ailment about 20 years ago.
She specializes in aquatic medicine a fish doctor, you could say.
