  An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
  An Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at visiting U.S. President George W. Bush and called him a "dog" in Arabic during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad on Sunday.
President George W. Bush ducked a pair of shoes hurled at his head  one shoe after the other  in the middle of a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
A man threw his shoes at President George W. Bush and was dragged away by security officials during the president's farewell trip to Iraq.
Reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president, who ducked and thus narrowly missed the attack, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily- fortified Green Zone.
Bush joked, saying that all he can report was that it was a size 10 shoe.
He then threw a shoe at Bush, who ducked and narrowly avoided it.
As stunned security agents and guards, officials and journalists watched, al-Zaidi then threw his other shoe, shouting in Arabic, "This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq!"
Muntadhar al-Zaidi, reporter of Baghdadiya television jumped and threw his two shoes one by one at the president, who ducked and thus narrowly missed being struck, raising chaos in the hall in Baghdad's heavily fortified green Zone.
"There is still more work to be done," Bush said after his meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, adding that the agreement puts Iraq on solid footing.
It was at that point the journalist stood up and threw his shoe.
Muntazer al-Zaidi jumped up as Bush held a press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, shouted "It is the farewell kiss, you dog" and threw his footwear.
As he and Maliki signed a security pact setting out new guidelines for US troops in Iraq, the president said: "The war is not over, but with the conclusion of these agreements... it is decisively on its way to being won."
The Iraqi journalist, Muntader al-Zaidi, 28, a correspondent for Al Baghdadia, an independent Iraqi station, stood up about 12 feet from Bush and shouted in Arabic: "This is a gift from the this is the farewell kiss, you dog!"
"The war is not over," Bush said, adding that "it is decisively on it's way to being won."
Bush was scheduled to meet with U.S. troops and Iraqi leaders about a recently completed security agreement, which calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces by 2011.
"All I can report," Bush joked of the incident, "is a size 10."
On a trip to Iraq shrouded in secrecy and dissent, President George W. Bush on Sunday hailed progress in the unpopular war that defines his presidency and got a size-10 reminder of opposition to his policies when a man hurled shoes at him during a news conference.

Zaidi, a reporter with the Al-Baghdadia channel which broadcasts from Cairo, was immediately wrestled to the ground by security guards and frogmarched from the room.
If you want the facts, it was a size 10 shoe that he threw".
A journalist hurled two shoes at President George W. Bush on his farewell visit to Iraq on Sunday, highlighting hostility still felt toward the outgoing US leader who acknowledged that the war is still not won.
"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said.
"There is still more work to be done," the president said about the war, but with the security agreement and the "the courage of the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi troops and the American troops and civilian personnel, it is decisively on its way to be won."
The incident occurred as Bush was appearing Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Bush had to duck out of the way, and narrowly missed being hit, according to on-scene reports.
But during a press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Bush received a taste of the immense resentment many Iraqis feel toward his policies: Just after Bush finished his remarks and said "Thank you" in Arabic, an Iraqi journalist took off his shoes and hurled them both at Bush, one after the other.
Al-Zeidi was one of several Iraqi journalists attending the Sunday evening news conference inside Baghdad's heavily secured International Zone.
Bush ducked, and it narrowly missed his head.
the man, identified as Muntadar al-Zaidi, a reporter with the Cairo-based network Al Baghdadia Television, yelled as he threw the shoes.
The president lowered his head and the first shoe hit the American and Iraqi flags behind the two leaders.
"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said jokingly.
Bush was not injured and joked about the incident.
Like many Iraqi reporters at the news conference, Nassar said he did not think this was an effective way for al-Zaidi to make his points.
Other Iraqi journalists in the front row of the news conference publicly apologized to Bush, who was uninjured and tried to brush off the incident by making a joke.
That shoe also narrowly missed Bush as al-Maliki stuck a hand in front of the president's face to help shield him.
"If you want the facts, it was a size 10," he joked.
Chaos immediately ensued as a scrum of al-Maliki's security agents jumped on the man, wrestled him to the floor and hustled him out of the ornate room where the news conference was taking place.
"This is a farewell kiss, dog," said Zaidi.
The drama unfolded shortly after Bush appeared at a news conference in Baghdad with Prime Minister Nouri Kamal al-Maliki to highlight the newly adopted security agreement between the United States and Iraq.
"This is a farewell kiss, you dog," he yelled in Arabic.
Later, Iraqi journalists identified him as Muntadar al-Zeidi, a correspondent for Al-Baghdadia, a satellite TV channel that broadcasts from Cairo, Egypt.
"This is from the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq," he said.
However, Bush tried to show himself calm and said "all I can report is it is a size 10."
Bush, on his fourth and final official trip to Iraq since he ordered the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam, admitted: "There is still more work to be done."
Al-Maliki reached out his hand to shield the president.
Seconds later, the journalist hurled his other shoe with similar precision as another Iraqi journalist reached over in an attempt to stop him.
Several security members wrestled the man to the floor and then dragged him out of the hall as he was screaming.
He was wrestled to the ground by security officials and then hauled away, moaning as they departed the room.
The crowd descended on al-Zeidi, who works for Al-Baghdadiya television, an Iraqi-owned station based in Cairo, Egypt.
Bush ducked and wasn't hit by either shoe.
Al-Maliki missed, but so did the shoe, landing like the first one with a loud thud against the wall behind the two leaders, who held their ground as other journalists and security officials wrestled the shoe-thrower to the ground.
``Al-Qaida's going to fight us wherever we are,'' he said.
The shoe attack came as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands.
"So what if a guy threw his shoe at me," the president added, dismissing it as "one way to gain attention."
  A Christian band that had expected to perform for President George W. Bush on Sunday night in Washington did not mind that the show would go on without him.
"All I can report is it is a size 10," he said, continuing to take a few questions and noting the apologies.
As with those trips, his fourth was surrounded in secrecy.
Another friend said al-Zaidi often ended his reports by saying "Reporting from occupied Baghdad, this is Muntader al-Zaidi."
"The station calls on journalists all over the world to express their solidarity for the release of al-Zeidi," it said.
At his news conference with al-Maliki, Bush described the security agreement as a landmark, signaling a new era in the war he began in the spring of 2003.
as he was surrounded by security agents, who tackled him to the floor and began to beat him.
shouted the man, later identified as Muntadar al-Zeidi, a correspondent for Al-Baghdadiya television, an Iraqi-owned station based in Cairo, Egypt.
The first shoe flew over the heads of other journalists and might have hit Bush square in the face had the lame-duck president not ducked.
``We are under threat,'' the president said.
Nassar also said al-Zaidi had asked to cover the news conference, since he was the chief correspondent.
President Bush on Sunday made a valedictory visit to Iraq, the country that will largely define his legacy, but the trip will more likely be remembered for the unscripted moment when an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at Bush's head and denounced him on live television as a "dog" who had delivered death and sorrow here from nearly six years of war.
The second shoe came quickly, and Bush ducked again while several Iraqis grabbed the man and dragged him to the floor.
This is the farewell kiss, you dog," the man said, according to a pool translation.
With the U.S. president's term ending, Iraqi politicians from parties other than al-Maliki's have been discussing whether to force the prime minister out with a no-confidence vote.
Both shoes narrowly missed their target and thumped loudly against the wall behind the leaders.
Bush ducked both shoes as they whizzed past his head and landed with a thud against the wall behind him.
Instead, he left the White House by car Saturday night, arriving at Andrews Air Force base at 9 p.m. to board Air Force One.
Zaidi was then detained on unspecified charges.
Bush allowed himself only a brief gloat over the Democrats' surrender  he showed only a hint of a smile when he noted that ``we removed the arbitrary timetables for withdrawal''  before moving on to outline the latest strategy in Iraq: targeting al-Qaida, of course.
The window shades were drawn for the entire flight.
  It sounded like something from a spy thriller.
Later, a trail of fresh blood could be seen on the carpet, although the source was not known.
He teased a reporter for wearing a loose necktie: ``Go ahead and take the tie off  it's halfway down anyway.''
His tone was jaunty, whether the topic was China (``They need to be eating U.S. beef.
Still, Bush's stalwart support for al-Maliki  after an initial period when the national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, expressed doubts about him  has been a bulwark against domestic political forces who sought to topple him.
The president displayed his legendary ability to stick to his message.
"They thought I was a different president."
The repetition technique, as usual, prevented Bush's questioners from eliciting more specifics about the war.
In the evening, the president flew by helicopter from the Green Zone to Camp Victory near Bahgdad airport, where he greeted hundreds of US troops under a huge US flag and a gigantic crystal chandelier in the Al Faw palace, formerly used by Saddam.
"Any procedure against Muntader will remind us of the behavior of the dictatorship and their violent actions, random detentions and mass graves," the channel said.
Shortly before 10 p.m., Bush left the Green Zone by helicopter to Camp Victory, where he was greeted with cheers and whoops from hundreds of troops inside the enormous rotunda of the Al Faw palace.
Bush offered in a recent interview that faulty intelligence that preceded the war was his "biggest regret," though he declined to say whether he would have changed course if he had known Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction.
Last week, at least 57 Iraqis were killed in a suicide attack at a popular restaurant outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
The number signifies that he is the nation's 43rd president.
Yet attacks have continued and many areas in Iraq remain unstable, particularly in the north.
But as frequently happens at presidential events these days, it quickly became al-Qaida, all the time.
It happened midway through his news conference in the Rose Garden Thursday morning, in between his 10th and 11th mentions of al-Qaida: A bird flew over the president and deposited a wet, white dropping on the upper left sleeve of his jacket.
 maybe the terrorist leader believes the superstition that bird poop is good luck.
Even Steve Hadley, the poker-faced national security adviser, smiled.
Gates, who Obama has picked to stay on at the Pentagon in the new administration, told US troops on Saturday: "We are in the process of the drawdown."
See, we're the ruse for him to go on his mission.
Bush landed in Iraq Sunday under a veil of secrecy for his fourth and presumably final stop as president in a war zone that will be central to defining his turbulent presidency.
The president wanted to highlight a drop in violence in a nation still riven by ethnic strife and to celebrate a recent U.S.-Iraq security agreement, which calls for U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011.
The U.S. president visited the Iraqi capital just 37 days before he hands the war off to President-elect Barack Obama, who has pledged to end it.
"I didn't feel the least threatened by it," Bush also said, adding that "it doesn't bother me" before he and Maliki leave the conference room.
"The work hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace," Bush said, adding: "I am just so grateful that I had a chance to come back to Iraq before my presidency ended."
Bush laughed off the incident, saying: "It doesn't bother me.
"Nobody knew who I was," Bush joked about the outfit.
To keep other reporters out of the loop, the White House put out false schedules detailing activities planned for Bush in Washington on Sunday.
Iraqi reporters started shouting what Bush later explained were apologies for the incident.
Bush joked that the media assembled for his trip was "a weak group," before heading back up to his part of the plane.
More recently, a far bigger crowd comprised of Iraqis who had opposed the security agreement did the same with an effigy of Bush in the same square, flinging their shoes at it before burning it.
The assailant  later identified as television correspondent Muntadar al-Zeidi  leapt from his chair and hurled his footwear at the president, who was about 20 feet away.
A group of 13 journalists picked by the White House accompanied Bush and senior aides on the trip.
Bush's arrival in Iraq during daylight hours had been one measure of his first visit on Thanksgiving Day 2003 took place entirely at night.
``It's a danger to your children, Jim,'' Bush informed the New York Times' Jim Rutenberg.
When NBC's Gregory asked Bush to explain why he's ``still a credible messenger on the war,'' the answer eventually arrived again at the al-Qaida threat: ``They're dangerous.
``We were warned about a lot of things,'' the president said before expanding anew on the al-Qaida threat.
That agreement includes a commitment to withdraw all American forces by the end of 2011.
The pact envisages US combat troops leaving Iraq by the end of 2011 and departing from all urban areas by June 30 next year.
Mark Hall, the lead singer of the band Casting Crowns, joked that he knew it all along.
Arriving in Baghdad Sunday for a farewell visit, President Bush staunchly defended a war that has taken far more time, money and lives than anticipated, saying the conflict "has not been easy" but was necessary for U.S. security, Iraqi stability and "world peace."
Bush himself played down the incident.
After meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani at Salam Palace, Bush hailed the security agreement as "a reminder of our friendship and as a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society."
Earlier in the day, Bush arrived Baghdad in an unannounced visit, just 36 days before he leaves office in January.
Crowds of people hurled their shoes at the giant statue of Saddam that once stood in Baghad's Firdos Square before helping U.S. Marines to pull it down April 9, 2003, the day the capital fell.
When U.S. Marines toppled Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in 2003, the assembled crowd whacked it with their shoes
Al-Maliki's partnership with Bush and his backing of the security agreement are unlikely to help him much once Bush leaves office.
To keep Bush's trip a secret, the White House put out a false schedule that said he would attend the taping of Turner Network Television's annual "Christmas in Washington" benefit concert at the National Building Museum.
After being pinned to the ground, the shoe-thrower was dragged out by security guards.
"Baghdadia TV channel also demands that the international and Iraqi television organizations cooperate in seeking the release of Muntader al-Zaidi."
In Iraqi culture, throwing shoes at someone is a sign of contempt.
Throwing a shoe at someone is considered the worst possible insult in Iraq, and is meant to show extreme disrespect.
Hitting someone with a shoe is considered the supreme insult in Iraq.
Upon arriving in the dark at Andrews Air Force Base on Saturday night, all of the reporters' belongings, except for one piece of reading material, were confiscated.
"We are, I believe, in terms of the American commitment, in the endgame here in Iraq."
On Saturday, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Iraq and said that the US mission was in its "endgame."
And I can't put it any more plainly: They're dangerous.''
"We were secretly a part of this whole thing.
As with previous visits  in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007  preparations for the visit were secretive and carried out with ruse.
Bush and his aides characterize the agreement as a sign of improvement, and Bush said earlier this week that the fight in Iraq was nearing "a successful end."
Bush wiped the mess off with his bare hand.
``He's not out feeding the hungry.''
The signing ceremony by Bush and Maliki marks the adoption of the Status of Forces Agreement approved by Iraq's parliament in November after months of political wrangling.
Many distrust any agreement made with an occupying power and while Bush is appreciated for having overthrown Saddam, he is widely blamed for the violence that raged in the years after the war, which forced more than a million Iraqis to flee and killed tens of thousands of civilians.
He's not leading many parades,'' the president reported.
The White House schedule for Sunday had Bush attending the "Christmas in Washington" performance at the National Building Museum in downtown Washington.
Bush's office had distributed a bogus public schedule that said he would attend a "Christmas in Washington" event Sunday night at the National Building Museum.
The goal: keep Bush and his entourage safe on the trip to Iraq.
The shoe-throwing incident also punctuated Bush's visit  his fourth  in a deeply symbolic way, reflecting the conflicted views in Iraq of a man who had toppled Saddam Hussein, ordered the occupation of the country and brought it the kind of freedoms unthinkable under Saddam's rule but at enormous costs.
With little advance notice, White House officials told 13 members of President George W. Bush's press corps about his hush-hush trip to Baghdad, instructed them to pack their bags and swore them to secrecy.
His sudden appearance in the press quarters was the only notice of his arrival for the trip.
He also called the incident a sign of democracy in the country, saying, "That's what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves," as the man's screaming could be heard outside.
The station issued a statement on the air Sunday night asking the Iraqi government to release al-Zeidi "to spare his life."
The television channel broadcast a request for al-Zaidi's release in the name of democracy and freedom of speech.
Contrary to usual practice, Air Force One was kept in a hangar at Andrews until shortly before takeoff Saturday night.
Bush arrived through an unmarked entrance at Andrews Air Force Base sporting his signature attempt at a disguise  a tan Windbreaker, casual black pants and a baseball cap marked with "43."
Air Force One landed in Baghdad at around 4 p.m. local time after a 10-1/2 hour overnight flight from Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
But just about everything else that came up during the hour-long news conference was traced to bin Laden's terrorist network.
Rutenberg, informed of the pet threat, asked Bush a follow-up question about bin Laden.
After several such iterations of the threat, the Times' Rutenberg asked Bush to be philosophical about bin Laden.
``They are a threat to your children, David,'' he advised NBC's David Gregory.
The answer went back to another restatement of the threat.
"I don't know what the guy's cause is...
But the top US commander in Iraq, General Raymond Odierno, who met with Gates, said that troops will stay in Iraqi cities in a support and training role after June.
Bush hands over the delicate task of overseeing the US withdrawal from Iraq in five weeks to Barack Obama, who has pledged to turn the page on the deeply unpopular war.
Five times, he offered a variation on his theme that war decisions belong to ``commanders on the ground, not politicians here in Washington.''
"He was committed to his job and after training in Lebanon became chief of correspondents about a month ago," said Haider Nassar, who worked with him at Baghdadia.
"He had bad feelings about the coalition forces," said Nassar, referring to the U.S.-led foreign military forces in Iraq.
This is not the first time his ouster has been discussed, but with U.S. power in Iraq on the wane and troops beginning to draw down in earnest, it seems a more serious threat.
"I'm so grateful that I've had a chance to come back to Iraq before my presidency ends," he said at a meeting with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.
He called the increased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq last year, a strategy known as the surge, which is credited with helping reduce violence here, "one of the greatest successes in the history of the United States military."
Bush has staunchly defended the invasion that triggered years of deadly insurgency and sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis and more than 4,200 American troops.
After Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in Baghdad in April 2003, many onlookers beat the statue's face with their soles.
His last visit comes against a backdrop of declining violence across Iraq, which the administration attributes to a buildup of thousands of reinforcements last year.
``He's not out there traipsing around.
In a rare move, President George W. Bush surprised the journalists joining him on the trip to Baghdad when he popped into Air Force One's press cabin for a chat.
Times special correspondents in Baghdad contributed to this report.
"This is so it's just the behavior of an individual.
Zaidi was later removed from the ornate room where the press conference was taking place.
Zaidi was seated in the second row of seats, about 12 feet from Bush's lectern.
Officials from Al-Baghdadia refused to comment.
But the moment clearly unnerved the aides of al-Maliki and some of the Americans in Bush's entourage, partly because it was televised and may have revealed a security lapse in the so-called Green Zone, the most heavily secured part of Baghdad.
Bush said, comparing the action to political protests in the United States.
A dozen journalists accompanying him were only told of the trip Friday and allowed to tell only a superior and a spouse  and only in person.
Soles of shoes are considered the ultimate insult in Arab culture.
While the travelers embarked, Air Force One remained hidden inside the immaculate and heavily guarded hangar specially constructed to house the enormous 747s used by the president.
Sadr's movement said it plans a protest on Monday in the holy city of Najaf.
The New York Times reported on Sunday that an unpublished US government report concluded that US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq were crippled by bureaucratic turf wars, violence and ignorance of the basic elements of Iraqi society, resulting in a 100-billion-dollar failure.
This last warning was perplexing, because Rutenberg has no children, only a brown chow named Little Bear.
CNN's Ed Henry asked why he ignored warnings that invading Iraq would help al-Qaida.
You know, I would hope our world hadn't become so cynical that they don't take the threats of al-Qaida seriously, because they're real.''
``Actually, I would call that a plan recommended by Baker-Hamilton, so it would be a Plan B-H,'' Bush answered, then checked to see how his joke about the Iraq Study Group went over.
Al-Baghdadia's Baghdad manager told the AP he had no idea what prompted his reporter to go on the attack.
Thrice, he offered a version of his al-Qaida theme: ``It's better to fight them there than here.''
"Don't worry about it," the president said as the room erupted into chaos.
Al-Zaidi's motivations in carrying out a potentially career-ending act were unclear, but friends described him as a devoted journalist.
The improved overall conditions in Iraq have had little discernible impact on the mood of the American public, which has said in polls that the invasion was a mistake.
His outburst came without warning as Bush and al-Maliki prepared to answer questions.
The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security conditions in the war-torn country.
``We have had good success in the chief operating officer position of al-Qaeda,'' he reported.
The agreement came after months of hard bargaining by Iraqi leaders, who insisted on a firm date for the removal of U.S. troops.
``They want to establish a caliphate.''
Weighing against it happening, however, is that there is no agreement on al-Maliki's successor or on how to divide Cabinet posts.
The session was called to draw attention to the fact that Democratic leaders had just caved in to Bush's demand that the Iraq spending bill have no withdrawal timeline.
"I am trying to reach Muntadar since the incident, but in vain," said Fityan Mohammed.
Once there, he casually slid his heel in and out of his shoe as he spoke.
They kicked him and beat him until "he was crying like a woman," said Mohammed Taher, a reporter for Afaq, a station owned by the Dawa Party, which is led by al-Maliki.
Dana Perino, the White press secretary, was visibly distraught, and NBC News reported she had been struck in the face by a microphone in the chaos.
Earlier, Bush ventured out in a motorcade through Baghdad streets, the first time he has gone somewhere other than a military base or the heavily protected Green Zone.
It means that the target is even lower than the shoe, which is always on the ground and dirty.
U.S. commanders have also credited the lower levels of violence to a ceasefire by anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and to the Sunni Awakening, in which former insurgents and tribal leaders turned their weapons against Sunni extremists.
Colleagues said al-Zeidi has done extensive reporting from Sadr City, the stronghold of anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and was rescued by Sadr's Mahdi Army militia after being abducted by an unidentified group in November 2007.
Pool reports said the unmarked motorcade passed through darkened streets that appeared heavily guarded, before arriving at Maliki's residence.
But when it came to the terrorists, Bush spoke with the cool ruthlessness of a dissident shareholder at an annual meeting.
It was unclear whether Bush was referring to a specific and credible threat to Little Bear or merely indicating there was increased ``chatter in the system'' about chows in general.
By mid-2008, the document said, 117 billion dollars had been spent on the reconstruction of Iraq, including about 50 billion in US taxpayer money, the newspaper reported.
He cited ``new opportunities to partner with local tribes to go after al-Qaida.''
``Because we haven't got him yet, Jim.''
Surprise is a favorite tactic of the Secret Service in a war zone.
Bush previously traveled to Iraq in November 2003, June 2006 and September 2007.
Obama has said he favours "a responsible withdrawal from Iraq" within 16 months of taking office.
So I feel like, you know, a little Jack Bauer right now," Hall said, referring to the counterterrorism agent on Fox TV drama "24."
The pact will govern the presence of 146,000 US troops at more than 400 bases when their UN mandate expires at the end of the year, giving the Iraqi government veto power over virtually all of their operations.
Problems also dog the massive economic reconstruction programme undertaken since the invasion.
While security in Baghdad and other parts of the country has significantly improved, there are still almost daily bomb attacks.
Speaking at a lectern beneath an enormous American flag that nearly reached the domed ceiling, he praised this generation of soldiers and reflected on the sacrifice of those who had died.
I didn't feel the least bit threatened by it."
The posts are split among the political blocs that control the parliament, and they would be loath to give up anything they have unless they were assured that they would get another position that was at least as good.
And Bush proceeded to favor his listeners with more intelligence bulletins about the al-Qaeda leader.
Bush's praise for the security agreement is particularly remarkable given that the U.S. administration spent years dismissing proposals for withdrawal timelines as dangerous admissions of defeat.
Although a majority of the Iraqi parliament approved the agreement, on the street, Iraqis have mixed views.
"As we predicted, the comments fly in the face of the security agreement," the head of the movement's political bureau, Liwaa Sumeissim, told AFP just before Bush's arrival.
Bush appeared to be in good spirits as he walked briskly across the lawn to the podium.
He also showed a playful interpretation of history, observing at one point that ``the Middle East looked nice and cozy for a while.''
``Now some may say, `Well, he's just saying that, you know, to get people to pay attention to him, or try to scare them for some reason.'
Bush invoked the terrorist group 19 times and even suggested it was going after individual reporters' kids.
Zaidi, colleagues said, was kidnapped by Shiite militiamen last year and was later released.
or allegations that Justice Department officials broke the law (``It's just grand political theater'').
They were told about the trip on Friday but were restricted to telling only a spouse and supervisor about the plans.
White House press secretary Dana Perino reported suffering a minor eye injury during the melee.
It gives fresh meaning to the phrase shooed away.
The Shiite radical movement of Moqtada Sadr, which strongly opposed the security deal, said Odierno's remarks showed that Washington had no intention of sticking by the deadlines.
