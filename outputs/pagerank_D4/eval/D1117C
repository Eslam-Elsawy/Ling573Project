Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that he would move swiftly to improve conditions for wounded soldiers being treated as outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he warned that senior officials would be held accountable for the poor conditions.
The Army's surgeon general on Thursday criticized stories in The Washington Post disclosing problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, saying the series unfairly characterized the living conditions and care for soldiers recuperating from wounds at the hospital's facilities.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates named an independent review panel Friday to investigate what he called an ``unacceptable situation'' in outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and he said that some soldiers ``most directly involved'' in the problems have been removed from their positions.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates says people found to have been responsible for allowing substandard living conditions for soldier outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington will be "held accountable," although so far no one in the Army chain of command has offered to resign.
The Pentagon said reviews of medical care at the premier military hospitals, Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center, have been launched by the army and navy's respective civilian chiefs.
``We own that building, and we're going to take charge of it,'' Cody said at the Pentagon.
Gates spoke to reporters after visiting the medical compound, whose reputation as a premier caregiver for soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan has taken a severe hit in the aftermath of a Washington Post series of reports last week that documented problems in soldiers' housing and in the medical bureaucracy at Walter Reed.
Pentagon officials have stressed that the quality of care at Walter Reed and other Army facilities is generally high.
The secretaries of the Army and Navy announced they had begun a broader review of Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center and announced that an independent review group will be formed to investigate outpatient care and administrative processes.
And that's what we're going to do.''
The action followed an investigation by the Washington Post that found that seriously wounded service members treated as outpatients at Walter Reed lingered there virtually forgotten for 18 months or more because of bureaucratic snafus.
Gates said the new commission, to include retired officials from the Pentagon, Congress and the armed services, would also look at conditions at the National Naval Medical Center nearby in Bethesda, Md., and any other military medical facilities they choose to examine.
Gates said he had no information suggesting there are problems at Bethesda similar to those at Walter Reed, but said the naval facility is being included because ``we need to know the scope of this problem.''
Gates announced that two former Army secretaries, Togo West and Jack Marsh, would head an independent panel to review treatment and administrative processes at Walter Reed, in Washington, and the National Naval Medical Center in the capital's Maryland suburbs.
As the number of service members wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan has climbed, Defense Department officials have held up Walter Reed as a facility offering unmatched care.
``I'm not sure it was an accurate representation,'' Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley, chief of the Army Medical Command which oversees Walter Reed and all Army health care, told reporters during a news conference.
The eight-member review group appointed by Gates has been charged with taking a broad look at all rehabilitative care and administrative procedures both at Walter Reed and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.
``That's going to take more than a couple of weeks, but we're going to get at it,'' he said.
Army and Defense Department leaders have promised to repair squalid conditions in Building 18, a former hotel outside the Walter Reed gate where 76 wounded soldiers are housed as outpatients.
A top Army general vowed Wednesday to personally oversee the upgrading of Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Building 18, a dilapidated former hotel that houses wounded soldiers as outpatients.
The White House and congressional leaders called Tuesday for swift investigation and repair of the problems plaguing outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, as veterans groups and members of Congress in both parties expressed outrage over substandard housing and the slow, dysfunctional bureaucracy there.
But he said the army was carrying out an investigation of conditions at the hospital and that there should be no doubt about President George W. Bush's commitment to veterans.
A senior US defense official, who asked not to be identified, said Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged the review and that results be quickly reported.
Asked to elaborate on his comments after the news conference at the facility, Kiley said he did not dispute any of the facts in the Post stories.
Col. Dan Baggio, the Army's chief of media relations, said Walter Reed's commander had already been thinking of briefing reporters on conditions at the medical center.
Gates said he was disappointed that the Defense Department did not uncover the problems itself.
He said he and Cody would report regularly to Defense Secretary Robert Gates on an action plan to fix the conditions.
"After the facts are established, those responsible for having allowed this unacceptable situation to develop will indeed be held accountable," Gates said, adding that so far no one involved has offered to resign.
``The senior Army leadership takes full responsibility for the lack of quality of life at Building 18, and we're going to fix it.''
Army Secretary Francis Harvey said an independent review group of about eight people will be established to look at outpatient care.
``It's a failure ... in the garrision leadership ... that should have never happened, and we are quickly going to rectify that situation,'' he said.
With responsibility comes accountability,'' Gates said.
The Washington Post reported Sunday and Monday on the challenges facing outpatients at Walter Reed.
In the US Senate, Democratic lawmakers said they were appalled and called for legislation that would require inspections and other measures designed to improve conditions at military hospitals.
The building is not ``emblematic of a process that abandons soldiers,'' said Kiley, who was commander at Walter Reed before becoming surgeon general in 2004.
An independent review group also will be formed to look into outpatient care and administrative process at the two hospitals.
Its operations are to be transferred to the Bethesda facility, which will be expanded and renamed the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
``We have a responsibility to communicate with the public about things going on at our command, regardless of who says they had the right of discovery.''
``I do not think that Building 8''  he apparently meant 18  ``is emblematic of a process of Walter Reed that has abandoned soldiers and their families,'' Kiley said.
But it also should not have taken newspaper articles to bring change to outpatient conditions at Walter Reed.
The actions came after stories in the Washington Post last weekend that revealed that wounded soldiers recuperating at Walter Reed often become mired in red tape as they seek further treatment or decisions about whether they will stay in the military.
Obama and Senator Claire McCaskill said they would introduce a bill seeking to raise standards at military hospitals for returning soldiers wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan.
But the Post said the poor treatment came later in the bureaucratic handling of some 700 people wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan who are being treated as outpatients but who are quartered on hospital grounds or nearby buildings.
Gates added that troops who had been wounded in service ``should not have to recuperate in substandard housing.''
Gates said the group has been asked to report its findings within 45 days.
Cody said the Army will review all its procedures for handling wounded soldiers and their families, and would seek to streamline systems for assistance.
Asked about Gates' statement that some have already been relieved of duty, Army officials said they were unsure that any such actions had been taken.
Gates met with top army officials earlier in the day, the official said.
Walter Reed's commander, Maj. Gen. George Weightman, said in an interview that the Army leadership had assured him all the staff increases he had requested would be met.
"We are not going to wait 45 days to begin addressing these problems," he said.
The articles also disclosed poor living conditions  including mold, filth and leaks  in Building 18, an Army facility housing recovering troops.
While acknowledging ``pretty distressing'' conditions in some rooms in Building 18, Kiley said the problems were not widespread, nor symptoms of a system that allows soldiers to languish.
After the media tour of Building 18, the Army's surgeon general gave a news conference.
The Pentagon said Winkenwerder's departure was already planned and not related to the problems at Walter Reed.
The US Defense Department said Tuesday it is reviewing the way wounded service members are cared for at military hospitals following disclosures of shocking bureaucratic neglect.
Cody and William Winkenwerder Jr., the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said at a news conference that they frequently visit Walter Reed and were surprised and disappointed by the living conditions and the fact that they had learned about them from media reports.
Walter Reed and the National Naval Hospital at Bethesda, Maryland near Washington are both renowned for their care of soldiers with combat injuries.
During his visit, Gates met a group of five soldiers being treated at the facility who spoke of a frustrating administrative bureaucracy at the hospital.
"And so there have been some people who are most directly involved who have been relieved.
``That's what we're correcting right now,'' he said.
And it described rooms in Building 18 with mold, leaky plumbing and holes in ceilings.
The Post series documented tattered conditions at Building 18, including mold, rot, mice and cockroaches, but also a larger bureaucratic indifference that has impeded some soldiers' ability to recover from their wounds.
"There's plenty of outrage," said White House spokesman Tony Snow, responding to a Washington Post report citing bitter complaints from veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center outside Washington.
Gates announced the creation of an eight-member commission to examine conditions at Walter Reed, on the outskirts of Washington, and other military hospitals, and make recommendations for improvements within 45 days.
Cody called the state of Building 18  where 76 soldiers live  ``inexcusable'' and said he will ``personally oversee'' its renovation.
Walter Reed's commander, Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman, says that conditions on the post will improve rapidly.
``He is, understandably, concerned and emphatic in wanting the best possible care for our wounded soldiers and for their families,'' Gates said.
``The problem is much more serious than one building,'' she said in an interview.
He said he did not know why the president, who has visited the facility many times in the past five years, had not heard about these problems before.
"We are committed to improving the clinical and administrative processes, including improving temporary living conditions for our service members and families," William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs said.
Walter Reed is set to close in 2011 and the naval facility in Bethesda, Md., will be expanded to handle the additional wounded.
``I'm grateful to reporters for bringing this to our attention, but thoroughly disappointed we did not identify it ourselves,'' Gates said in his first public remarks addressing the situation.
"After the facts are established, those responsible for having allowed this unacceptable situation to develop will indeed be held responsible," Gates said.
``Accordingly, after the facts are established, those responsible for allowing this situation to develop will indeed be held accountable.''
He promised to ``go at this thing soup to nuts,'' adding: ``We're gonna get at it real quickly.''
"With responsibility comes accountability."
Only a day before, Gen. Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff, said: "We were absolutely disappointed in the status of the rooms and found the delays and lack of attention to detail to the building's repairs inexcusable."
``They were trying to brief us on a story when we didn't know what the story was about.''
In Sunday's Washington Post, Dana Priest and Anne Hull described the woeful conditions of Room 205 in Walter Reed's Building 18: ``Behind the door of Army Spc.
At the White House, spokesman Tony Snow said he spoke with the president Tuesday about Walter Reed and the president told him: ``Find out what the problem is and fix it.''
Speaking on background, an Army official said they included several soldiers involved in supervising facilities at Walter Reed, including Building 18.
The Post last week gave the Army six days to respond to the paper's investigation into decaying, cockroach-infested facilities and an overwhelmed patient-care bureaucracy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Northwest Washington.
Lost paperwork, which in one case resulted in an obviously impaired veteran getting an order to report to Germany, is a constant problem, sometimes forcing soldiers and their relatives to live at Walter Reed for 18 months or longer as their cases are processed.
Both reports said Weightman spoke in advance of The Post's stories.
Until now, the Army had not challenged any aspect of the Post series.
I'm not sure why that is,'' Winkenwerder said.
Spiegel's Times piece Sunday said Weightman ``has acknowledged that the staff responsible for tracking patients after they receive treatment was overwhelmed by the number of wounded when violence spiked in Iraq two years ago.''
But the large number of patients there, currently about 650, has forced officials to rely on overflow facilities nearby more than they have in the past and has caused long waits for some treatments, officials acknowledged.
He said no hospital officials had offered to resign but several lower-level employees overseeing outpatient care had been relieved on their duties.
``That's tough to do while you're trying to take care of soldiers,'' he said.
``We needed to do a better job on some of those rooms, and those of you that got in today saw that we frankly have fixed all of those problems.
``Some of this bureaucracy, as much as it frustrates us, I'm not sure that's a breakdown in leadership,'' he reasoned.
"A bedrock principle of our military system is that we empower commanders with the responsibility, authority and resources necessary to carry out their mission," Gates said.
``We just tried not to be in a position to identify ourselves to anyone who would report us to public affairs and have us kicked off the base.''
There were signs of hasty repairs: a plumber's truck outside, dust masks and spray cleaners on window sills, rat poison outside the dumpster, and a discarded box proclaiming ``Emergency Exit Lighting Fixture.''
Amputees and patients on taxing drug regimens are required to report for formation early in the morning, even if it means trudging over accumulated ice and snow.
His response is commendable, and it should not be forgotten that thousands of professionals and volunteers, civilian and military, are working hard to help veterans heal and adjust.
Also, a medic will now be stationed 24 hours a day at the Mologne House, the largest residence on the 113-acre post, to help soldiers with medical or psychological issues.
If the Army determined that he was mentally fit to serve in the first place, it cannot now abscond from its responsibility for the consequences of his service overseas.
But the Army succeeded in putting its stamp on some stories.
``Unfortunately, I had to stand up and tell them, `Hey, the room is messed up,''' he told a Voice of America camera.
Dell McLeod, who suffered a head injury that left him aimless and unable even to count change at the cafeteria.
Such unspoken agreements, however, are hardly iron-clad.
A broken elevator was repaired and snow and ice was cleared from the sidewalks.
``In the next room, there's a little water drop on the you can get a nice shot of it,'' Kiley joked.
Staff writers Steve Vogel and William Branigan contributed to this report.
``Some of the paint is still wet against that wall, so be careful,'' Walter Reed public affairs officer Donald Vandrey, standing on the bed in his socks, advised the film crews.
``They just finished repainting it about 10 minutes ago.''
Inside Room 416, there was indeed some rainwater dripping into a wastebasket, a missing lampshade, some loose wallpaper and a mirror on the floor  but neither rodents nor fungus visible.
The tour began in the game room, where soldiers shot pool and watched a plasma TV.
Spokesman Vandrey spoke like a real estate agent: ``There was no plumbing leakage in the bathroom.
Staff writer Ann Scott Tyson contributed to this report.
For all the stagecraft, there was still broken glass in the driveway of Building 18 Thursday, a banana peel on the steps and an empty Budweiser can in the shrubbery.
Soldiers who lost their uniforms while undergoing emergency treatment on the battlefield have had to present their purple hearts to get replacement clothes.
The walls of one soldier's room were covered with black mold, and the ceiling of his shower had a large hole.
At Building 18 Tuesday, platoon sergeants with clipboards went room-to-room inspecting for mold, leaks and other problems.
Winkenwerder said the group would report back to the Pentagon in a ``short time frame.''
Top Army officials Tuesday visited Building 18, the decrepit former hotel housing more than 80 recovering soldiers, outside the gates of the medical center.
It quoted many patients and their families describing a bureaucratic indifference to medical needs.
They have also promised to address bureaucratic problems that have impeded care.
But Baggio acknowledged the timing was dictated by the upcoming Post stories, which ran Sunday and Monday and detailed inadequate care for wounded veterans.
Kiley's comments came at the conclusion of a media tour during which reporters and television cameras were escorted through Building 18 to view conditions and repairs.
Gates, speaking to reporters after touring the facilities and speaking to several patients, said he was upset by reports in The Washington Post describing wounded soldiers living in dilapidated buildings near the Walter Reed campus and portraying the massive paperwork and other bureaucratic hurdles they had to overcome during treatment.
And while filthy conditions at Building 18 are a temporary problem for these veterans, lowball settlements may leave soldiers and their families impoverished for life.
``You could put all of the wounded soldiers in the Ritz-Carlton and it wouldn't fix the personnel, management and record-keeping problems that keep them languishing in outpatient limbo out there for months while paperwork from 11 disjointed systems gets shuffled and lost,'' Davis said.
Gates met with President Bush Friday morning to brief him on the actions underway.
Weightman said that case managers have been ordered to call each of the 700 outpatients to ask about problems they may be encountering.
The Army's top medical officer, Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley, described the newspaper's account as a "one-sided representation" at a news conference Thursday, emphasizing that he was objecting to the tone of the stories, not the facts.
One Army official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Army also is undertaking its own review of what happened at Walter Reed, said officials are considering possible personnel changes.
He sure did  and that's why Kiley, who was the commander at Walter Reed before assuming his current role in 2004, found himself staring into a bank of 12 cameras Thursday.
``I want to reset the thinking that while we have some issues here, this is not a horrific, catastrophic failure at Walter Reed.''
In a letter to Walter Reed's staff this week, Weightman said that ``information for this article was covertly obtained over more than two years by reporters who did not wish to bring their findings to the leadership for action.''
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked the House Armed Services Committee to conduct an investigation of outpatient care at Walter Reed.
He described the medical care itself at the hospital as ``unsurpassable'' and said the shortcomings were confined to ``the outpatient aspect of this.''
Speaking to reporters during a visit to the Army hospital in the District of Columbia, Gates also warned that senior military leaders could be disciplined based on the findings of the review group.
Their report is due within 45 days and will be made public, Gates said.
``Some of these people are not on our list and are not coming in,'' announced Lori Calvillo, Walter Reed's chief spokeswoman.
The Army's public affairs office used the time to summon journalists from other news organizations to a briefing at which Walter Reed's commander responded to the findings  in an article that had not yet been published.
Harvey said he was surprised and disappointed at the conditions and the frustrating bureaucratic delays.
There is rare unanimity in Washington on the need to treat wounded soldiers well, Gates said, ``and so we're determined to fix it, and fix it fast.''
But we will be looking and evaluating the rest of the chain of command as we get more information."
The Army declined to identify publicly the personnel who have been moved to different positions at the hospital.
Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., former head of the House Government Reform Committee, urged the committee to hold a hearing at Walter Reed to give members an ``invaluable firsthand look'' at how the Army is processing the wounded.
``We empower commanders with responsibility, authority and resources necessary to carry out their missions.
The Army's vice chief of staff, only 24 hours earlier, decried ``a breakdown in leadership'' for the conditions in the place.
``We get concerns all the time directed to us.
The Post said some soldiers were staying in a building infested with mold and rodents and roaches.
The general also seemed to miss a larger point identified by other officials: Walter Reed's problem isn't of mice and mold but a bureaucracy that has impeded the recovery of wounded soldiers.
Kiley said that while repairs to Building 18 are nearly complete, the aging facility needs a top-to-bottom renovation.
He then attacked the ``one-sided representation'' of the Post reporting.
He said Bush ``first learned of the troubling allegations regarding Walter Reed from the stories this weekend in The Washington Post.
The proposed "legislation would cut red tape, improve service, and require frequent inspections of all active duty military hospitals," Obama said in a statement.
He is deeply concerned and wants any problems identified and fixed.''
``Improvements to date have been episodic, and in some case, short-lived,'' Davis said in a statement.
The two-part newspaper series reported that many soldiers spend 18 months or more at Walter Reed.
He said he met earlier Friday with President Bush to discuss the situation.
The outpatients at Walter Reed have received initial treatment but require further care or rehabilitation before retiring from the armed forces or returning to active duty.
"The brave men and women wounded at war should receive the best we have to offer and the highest quality of care," said Democratic Senator Barack Obama, a presidential hopeful for the 2008 race and outspoken opponent of the Iraq war.
``I want to reset the thinking,'' Kiley added.
He said he had not suffered any reprisals.
Maj. Gen. George Weightman, Walter Reed's commander, viewed the matter differently, Baggio said.
The Defense Department is never shy about asking for supplemental funds for operations and I cannot imagine why housing for recuperating wounded would not be a similarly high priority.''
Missing was Maj. Gen. George Weightman, the current Walter Reed commander  ``called away to important business,'' Kiley explained.
The group will be co-chaired by Togo West, who was secretary of veterans affairs and secretary of the Army during the Clinton administration, and by John ``Jack'' Marsh, who was secretary of the Army under President Reagan and a former member of Congress from Virginia.
To the Army's public affairs chief, it was simply an effort to ``get the facts out from our perspective.''
``While we have some issues here, this is not a horrific, catastrophic failure at Walter Reed.''
His comment suggested that senior officials in the Army chain of command would not be immune from disciplinary action.
She said Weightman was responsive during a two-hour interview Thursday, Feb. 15, but she initially thought he was joking when he said he would be briefing other news organizations on Walter Reed's problems the following day.
Hospital officials in recent days have moved to clean up the most visible problems.
And Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., noted that ``you could put all the wounded soldiers in the Ritz-Carlton, and it wouldn't fix the personnel management and record-keeping problems that keep them languishing in outpatient limbo out there for months.''
But we never got a concern sent our way about this issue, which is a little surprising.
``It made us feel very uncomfortable that we were being set up to be the Army's public affairs arm,'' said Los Angeles Times correspondent Peter Spiegel, who attended the Pentagon session.
Jeremy Duncan lived amid black mold and a hole in the ceiling above the shower.
Back in Room 205, the whitewash was almost dry.
They have said that the poor conditions, which included moldy walls, cockroaches, mouse droppings and stained carpets, were confined to a 54-room Army-owned facility across the street from the main Walter Reed campus where nearly 70 recovering service members are being housed.
Other members include two former members of Congress, three retired senior military officers and a retired command sergeant major.
At times, Kiley appeared to acknowledge a systemic problem.
An AP report Saturday evening began: ``The commander of the Army's leading medical facility acknowledges problems in outpatient treatment but said the hospital is working to address the concerns of patients and their families.''
The bill would also require the Army to report more regularly to the Congress and the Inspector General about conditions injured soldiers.
In other cases, it took months for wounded soldiers to get disability pay or a decision on whether they would remain in the service.
Standards of medical care at Walter Reed remain high, he said, but he acknowledged: ``The trust has taken a hit here.
``It was a one-sided representation.''
Gates said caseworkers are ``overwhelmed'' by the numbers of patients they are assigned, and he indicated more workers would be soon assigned to the hospital.
``In the warrior ethos the last line says you should never leave a fallen comrade, and from that facility point of view we didn't live up to it ... and it looks to me we may have not lived up to it from a process side,'' he said, adding that conditions at the building are ``inexcusable.''
``So that's one thing that can be addressed pretty quickly.''
``It's going to be easy for everyone to duck this problem after the building is fixed if we don't fix the completely dilapidated administrative system.''
Gates said of the accounts in The Post: "I have not seen anything or heard anything" that led him believe the articles "were in any substantial way wrong."
``There's just too much work for the number of people that are available,'' he said.
And I think it's our job to repair that trust and to re-earn that trust.
Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, blasted the Army Wednesday, saying in a statement that it has known for years about shortcomings at Walter Reed.
Cody blamed ``a breakdown in leadership'' for the troubling conditions but said no one has been fired or relieved of command.
``We had some NCOs (noncommissioned officers) who weren't doing their job, period,'' Harvey said.
Jeff Miller, R-Fla., ranking member on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on health, said, ``the neglect being experienced by some wounded service members is outrageous.
``We never lied to anyone about who we were,'' Priest said.
Army Secretary Francis Harvey and Vice Chief of Staff Richard Cody toured the building and spoke to soldiers as workers in protective masks stripped mold from the walls and tore up soiled carpets.
said Rep. Bob Filner, D-Cailf., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.
Gen. Richard Cody, the Army vice chief of staff, used terminology similar to that of a military campaign to describe his plan to overhaul the broken building, including giving it a more ``appropriate'' name, and the sluggish bureaucracy for outpatient care.
Jeremy Duncan's room, part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, weighted down with black mold.
``I do not consider Building 18 to be substandard,'' he said of a facility Priest and Hull found full of ``mouse droppings, belly-up cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses'' and other delights.
An Army sergeant who oversees the management of Building 18 said three requests for service were made to repair Duncan's room  one in November, one in January, and one last week  but nothing happened.
Duncan, who suffered a broken neck while on patrol in Iraq last year, was moved to a new room after the Post story described his living conditions.
But then he quibbled with the scope of the problem.
What doesn't get mentioned is the bureaucratic contempt and physical squalor that too often await badly injured outpatient soldiers on the Walter Reed campus, the subject of a four-month Post investigation detailed in articles published Sunday and Monday.
Priest first contacted the Army on Monday, Feb. 12, and provided a list of 30 questions about conditions at Walter Reed.
``We're not letting soldiers languish,'' came Kiley's reply.
The members are Togo West, secretary of veterans affairs and secretary of the Army under President Bill Jack Marsh, secretary of the Army under President Ronald Dr. Joe Schwarz, a former Republican congressman from Jim Bacchus, a former Democratic congressman from and four retired military officers, Gen. John Jumper, former Air Force chief of Lt. Gen. Chip Roadman, former Air Force surgeon Rear Adm. Kathy Martin, former Navy deputy surgeon and Command Sgt.
Army officials are now questioning the paper's handling of the probe.
He said the building had been upgraded several times and called the furniture ``very nice'' but said the walls and infrastructure were not ``up to speed'' and required inspections were not done or were not rigorous enough.
``Because we had a long holiday weekend coming up and we knew the story was coming out about Walter Reed, he felt an obligation to make sure to get the facts out from our perspective,'' Baggio said.
``This is their number one priority.''
They weren't serious, and there weren't a lot of them.''
``It's not the Ritz-Carlton at Pentagon City, I'll grant you that,'' Kiley said, surveying the newly cleaned, repaired and repainted room where until recently Army Spec.
In another development Thursday, the White House announced that President Bush plans nominate Ward Casscells to replace William Winkenwerder as assistant defense secretary for health affairs.
Harvey said the building would be renamed after a Army doctor, medic or nurse who was killed in action.
Norton said that she thinks Congress will have to compel the Army to overhaul its outpatient care system but that immediate steps are needed to help soldiers trapped in the existing bureaucracy.
He did point to lower-ranking officers and noncommissioned officers lacking ``the right experience and the authority to be able to execute some of the missions.''
The Senate Armed Services Committee has tentatively scheduled hearings on the facility for March 6, said a spokeswoman for the panel's chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking minority member of the committee, toured the facility Friday.
When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up, he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole.''
Rooms had been painted, plumbing repaired and floors reeked of disinfectant.
Then it was down to Room 205, crammed with Tilex, sealant, paint rollers, a dropcloth and ceramic tiles.
She then attempted to evict a Washington Post reporter, who appealed, loudly, to Kiley.
The army also is investigating allegations raised by the Post that a former official in charge of seeing that private donations got to wounded soldiers was at the same time raising funds for a private charity.
And television crews were invited in to inspect the result.
But the Post reports prompted several days of damage control by Army and Pentagon officials that have veered back and forth between acknowledging the situation and playing it down.
Kiley might have had a stronger case if men wearing Tyvek hazmat suits and gas masks hadn't walked through the lobby while the camera crews waited for the tour to start, or if he hadn't acknowledged, moments later, that the entire building would have to be closed for a complete renovation.
He has also put half-dozen senior enlisted officers from the hospital in charge of the outpatients' companies normally in the hands of lower level platoon sergeants.
Several senators, including Democratic presidential candidate Barak Obama of Illinois and former presidential candidate John Kerry, D-Mass., announced they are co-sponsoring legislation to simplify the paperwork process for recovering soldiers and increase case managers and psychological counselors.
The following editorial appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post:
``The treatment reported in the Post of our troops and our veterans is disgraceful,'' said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly.
It's not every day one gets to witness a whitewash in action, but Walter Reed Army Medical Center provided just such an opportunity Thursday.
Every patient or family member quoted by name, she said, had agreed to be on the record.
That, said Baggio, was done as a ``courtesy.''
``They battled our foreign enemies, they should not have to battle an American bureaucracy,'' Gates said.
Walter Reed's fixes are unlikely to immediately quiet the drumbeat of criticism that erupted among members of Congress who received a flood of calls from the public and veterans groups asking how the problems could have been unknown to officials, some of whom visit Walter Reed on a regular basis.
``It's not the accuracy I question, it's the characterization,'' he said.
When journalists seek a response from a government agency on a pending story, there is generally an understanding that the information will not be shared with rival news outlets before publication.
"The men and the women who have gone and fought for our country over there, they deserve the best care," Snow said.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., echoed Davis' concerns after she toured Building 18 and spoke to soldiers.
At the Friday briefing, reporters were told that Weightman's remarks were embargoed until late Saturday afternoon, around the time The Post's story was expected to be posted online.
He said the Army has agreed to fund what he called a ``surge plan'' that has been designed for the likelihood that the 21,500-person troop increase now under way in Iraq will result in more casualties.
The main Walter Reed hospital is scheduled to close by 2011.
If you listen to the PR operation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the U.S. military's gleaming flagship hospital offers veterans the best treatment available.
Panel members ``will be given free and unrestricted access'' to visit medical facilities and interview personnel, Gates said.
Most infuriating are reports of official efforts to deny disability benefits to discharged fighters.
After an internal debate, said Spiegel of the Los Angeles Times, ``it seemed to us pointless to try to cobble something together'' without The Post's findings.
From there, the tourists climbed a stairwell smelling of chlorine bleach to a floor smelling of fresh paint.
Painters were deployed to cover the offending wall with a fresh coat of white semigloss.
Priest, saying the inquiry lasted four months, not two years, declined to explain how she and Hull repeatedly signed into Walter Reed without the knowledge of the Army brass.
Reporters Dana Priest and Anne Hull and researcher Julie Tate spent hundreds of hours inspecting conditions and interviewing injured troops and their loved ones at the Walter Reed outpatient facilities.
To Dana Priest, who covers national security for The Washington Post, it was a case of Army officials ``shooting themselves in the foot, because reporters are not going to trust them.''
Outside the room, a man spoke urgently into his cellphone: ``The drywall has to dry before they can paint.''
Treasury Department officials last year gave the Wall Street Journal declassified information about a secret program to track the banking records of terror suspects after failing to persuade the New York Times to kill a planned story on the subject.
Their findings: Veterans' rooms are bureaucratic hassles and paper-pushing make the process of repairing buildings, redressing patient grievances and providing veterans with basic goods depressingly administrators' neglect of patients' mental and physical health borders on the and, most distressing, many veterans leave Walter Reed without the compensation they clearly deserve for their sacrifices.
Army officials' argument: Because he had done poorly in high school, his current mental state might not have been caused by the steel door that smashed his skull in Iraq.
Kiley said the Army was beginning to study ways to streamline the medical bureaucracy, including the process by which soldiers are medically evaluated and either discharged or returned to active duty.
McLeod ended up getting a settlement from the command at Walter Reed  despite base staffers' best efforts  only after his wife got a congressional staffer involved.
Journalists from the Boston Globe, USA Today, the Associated Press and Fox News also attended the invitation-only briefing.
