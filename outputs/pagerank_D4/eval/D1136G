The level in the Three Gorges reservoir reached the 156-meter mark in October with a storage of 8.65 billion cubic meters in 2006, three percent of the total water flow in the city, according to the bureau.
The Three Gorges Dam in central China's Hubei Province Thursday has opened its floodgates to ease the severe water shortages along the Yangtze River.
The Yangtze River, the nation's largest, has experienced the lowest water levels in around a hundred years since last summer due to scarce rainfall and severe drought in the upper reaches, according to the Yangtze River Hydrology Bureau.
China's central and western regions will suffer an annual water shortage of about 20 billion cubic meters from 2010 to 2030, the report said.
Chinese hydrology experts have denied that last year's serious drop in water levels in China's longest river, the Yangtze, are connected with the Three Gorges hydroelectric project.
Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, over the last two weeks, leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages, local water authorities said on Monday.
Yangtze water levels hit a record low in 2006, while its tributaries dropped 30 to 60 percent below average levels, according to the bureau.
The Yangtze River hydrology bureau attributed the drop to lower rainfall on the upper reaches and serious drought along the river.
Chongqing and neighboring Sichuan Province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze suffered their worst water shortages in more than a century last summer when the water level and rainfall nearly halved.
The Yichang hydrology station, a little downstream from the dam, recorded only 64 percent of average annual water flow, the lowest since hydrology records began in 1877.
Shandong currently has 16 plants desalinating 32,000 cubic meters of sea water per day, 57 percent of the country's total.
The flow of water into the dam measured 3,700 cubic meters per second and the water level at the dam was 153.43 meters on Sunday afternoon, which safeguard the operation of the dam and navigation in the lower reaches, they said.
The central government is "very serious about the commitment and has firmly demanded all regions to meet the emissions reduction targets," he said.
China increased its grain production 2.8 percent to 497.46 million tonnes in 2006, but the world's most populous nation still faces the prospect of shortages, state press reported Thursday.
This year, China's southwestern Chongqing Municipality and neighbouring province Sichuan were ravaged by the worst drought in more than 50 years.
East China's Shandong Province, a coastal region that suffers from a shortage of fresh water, will invest 3.6 billion yuan over the next four years to build 21 sea water desalination plants.
The company said the dam could release an additional 6.1 billion cubic meters of water to the lower reaches by reducing the reservoir's water level from the current 155 meters to 144 meters.
China already faces a severe water shortage, especially in the northern part of the country.
Reefs exposed, ships stranded and fish stocks plummeting, the continuing ordeal of China's Yangtze River has been exacerbated by the worst water shortage in more than a century.
The flow at Yichang City, where the Three Gorges dam is located, was 284.4 billion cubic meters last year, 64 percent of the average, the lowest since 1877 when records began.
Sources with the China Three Gorges Project Corporation said the water shortage in the upper reaches had not affected the world's largest water storage facility.
A long drought in the upper reaches of the Yangtze saw the water level in the middle reaches drop to their lowest point in more than a century.
Even if the reservoir had stored no water, the flow at Yichang City would have hit a record low, said Cheng Haiyun, bureau chief engineer.
The lake's water level has been falling continuously since last July as it supplies water to the drought-stricken Yangtze River.
It also "lags behind Europe and the United States" in the technology needed to burn cleaner coal, which accounts for 69 percent of its energy output, said Qin Dahe, chief of the China Meteorological Administration, and an adviser to the government on climate change.
Production last year was 13.46 million tonnes more than in 2005, as annual grain output in China increased for the third year running, but still short of the country's demand, the China Daily said.
China is among the driest countries in the world, and 400 out of 600 Chinese cities suffer from water shortages for domestic and industrial uses.
China plans to cut its average water consumption by 20 percent by the end of 2010 in an effort to avert a looming shortage crisis, state media reported Thursday.
Heatwaves hit Chongqing municipality and Sichuan province in the upper Yangtze last summer, and rainfall was nearly halved in most sections of the Yangtze, resulting in a severe drought.
The bureau said that in 2006, the tributaries reported 30 to 40 percent less water flow than average.
Cheng Haiyun, the bureau's chief engineer, earlier denied that the record low water level in the Yangtze was connected with the Three Gorges hydropower project.
The water shortage has affected the whole ecology of the Yangtze.
Wang blamed a glut of power plants in the Yangtze's upper reaches for the decline in water, but did not link the water shortages with the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze.
The world's largest hydropower project has been releasing bigger quantities of water since late December, according to the China Three Gorges Project Corporation.
The water level at 2 p.m. on Tuesday was just 7.48 meters, according to statistics from Xingzi Station of Poyang Hydrological Center.
Qin served as one of China's representatives to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which last week announced that global warming is very likely caused by mankind and that climate change will continue for centuries.
In the latter half of this century production of wheat, corn and rice in China will drop by as much as 37 percent, and the country's average temperatures would rise by 2 or 3 degrees Celsius in the next 50 to 80 years, the report said.
China only recycles 60 to 65 percent of its industrial water, compared with 80 to 85 percent in developed countries, the agency said.
China had 105.38 million hectares of land for grain crops last year, an increase of 1.1 million hectares over the previous year, according to the latest statistics cited by the state news agency Xinhua.
Like many Chinese regions, Shandong is suffering a worsening water shortage, but its 3,024 kilometers of coastline offers the solution of desalinating sea water.
The number of migratory birds in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, has dropped by 40 percent.
Meanwhile, the shipping industry along the Yangtze is also feeling the effects of the water shortage.
The Three Gorges dam has opened its floodgates to feed the river, but statistics from monitoring stations in central China's Hubei province and east China's Jiangsu province have shown no perceptible rise in water levels.
The local hydrological bureau said water levels in the Yangtze and Jialing rivers had declined sharply in recent weeks due to a lack of rainfall.
Water in the upper reaches decreased by over 60 percent from the previous year, and cities downstream reported the lowest water levels since records were first kept in 1877.
On Sunday, the water level at Cuntan hydrological station in Chongqing measured 158.43 meters, only 35 centimeters higher than the record low reported in 1987, said a bureau spokesman surnamed Wang.
But in fact the drought is only part of the story of the Yangtze's sad decline.
But a severe drought is still likely to affect the southeastern part of the city in mid July.
"Dwindling water reserves have made it harder for fish to survive, including endangered species like baiji, or white-flag dolphins, and increased the risks of them being injured by passing ships," said Wang Zhenxi, director of fishery management in Tongling, Anhui province.
China also includes legumes, such as beans, and oil bearing seeds, as part of its grain statistics.
Local maritime authorities have dispatched dredgers to dig out sludge, and in some places, they took the drastic step of exploding reefs to make navigation possible.
Large vessels were ordered to unload shipments or banned from navigation to ease the traffic jam caused by shrinking waterways.
"There is huge potential for water saving in China," said Wang Shucheng, minister of water resources.
Local maritime bureaus have increased patrols to issue warnings and prevent ships from running aground.
Double-digit economic growth and a growing population are putting a heavy strain on China's limited water resources, and the consequences are beginning to show.
The Yangtze maritime authority said the situation will improve in February.
"It takes time to catch up," he said at a news conference.
As the once-mighty Yangtze threads its way through 11 regions in China, water is intensively siphoned off for factories, hydroelectric schemes and agriculture.
The Yangtze River, the third longest in the world after the Nile and the Amazon, runs from far west Qinghai and Tibet through 186 cities including Chongqing, Wuhan and Nanjing before emptying into the sea at Shanghai.
No break down was given on the differing grains.
The government also aims to establish 100 pilot water-saving schemes in the run- up to 2010, and to roll out successful projects across the nation, according to the agency.
The salvage operation lasted five hours.
The exposed riverbed near the wharf has become a temporary playground for locals to sunbathe and fly kites.
The office predicted the drought would last until after the rainy season begins in May, but will return in the middle of summer and will last for at least 30 days.
It follows last summer's severe drought that forced tens of thousands of farmers to eke out a living away from home - many ended up picking cotton in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
The Yangtze River, the third longest in the world after the Nile and the Amazon, runs from far west Qinghai and Tibet through 186 cities including Chongqing, Wuhan and Nanjing before emptying into the sea in Shanghai.
On Monday, the local maritime bureau suspended navigation in the area between 12:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. every day for surveying and dredging.
Experts blamed the low water level of the 330,000-hectare lake for the decrease.
Qin and other scientists are preparing to brief the central government on climate change based on the findings of the UN study.
China is concerned about global warming but lacks the money and technology to significantly reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions that are worsening the problem, a top government scientist said Tuesday.
He said China agreed with and was concerned about the report's conclusions.
"All the water in the southwest of China is fed by glacial melt," he said.
The water resources in Shandong meet only one third of the province's demand.
Once built, the plants will turn out about 140 million cubic meters of fresh water every year, according to a government plan.
China faces the possibility of a 48 million tonne grain shortage in 2010, equal to nearly nine percent of the country's grain consumption, according to a recent study published by the ruling Communist Party's central school.
According to the State Development and Reform Commission and some other state- level agencies, desalinated seawater is expected to contribute 16 to 24 percent of the water supply in coastal areas by 2010, with a daily processing capacity of up to 3 million cubic meters in 2020.
It also warned that coastal areas will be at a greater risk of flooding as China's sea level will climb 1 to 16 centimeters by 2030.
Over 9,000 chemical plants line the banks of China's longest waterway, 45 percent of the national total.
The report also predicted that more floods and droughts will hit the country as water evaporates more rapidly from rivers.
"Continuing water shortages, which date from long before the drought, have had a drastic effect on fish resources in the Yangtze, which is home to most of China's freshwater fish species, " said Li Zhenye, director of the marine farm administration in Tongling.
Yangtze fishermen, who make their living on the river, are experiencing a sharp drop in their earnings.
"If the water levels in the Yangtze and its upper tributary Jialing River continue to decline, we'll face a real crisis," he said.
But no long-term solutions for China's longest river have so far been defined, and the Yangtze's sad decline seems destined to continue.
In Anqing, the water is only four meters deep, and will continue to drop as the drought continues, Zhou said.
"The Chinese are facing an incredible water-stressed economy," Justin Mundy, a government adviser on climate change said.
A separate Chinese report released last month said climate change could cause large drops in agricultural output over the coming decades.
China's output of major crops, including rice, wheat and corn, could fall by up to 37 percent in the second half of this century if no effective measures are taken to curb greenhouse gases in the coming 20 to 50 years, according to the report.
The average temperature in China has risen by 0.5 to 0.8 degree centigrade in the past century and is expected to go up another two to three degrees centigrade in the coming 50 to 80 years, it said.
The nation of 1.3 billion people needs to feed its growing population but its arable land is increasingly being lost to expanding cities and environmental degradation.
Dongting Lake, China's second largest freshwater lake in central China's Hunan province, which is fed by the Yangtze, has to absorb discharges from over 230 paper-making factories.
However, the country's arable land had shrunk from 131 million hectares in 1996 to 123 million hectares in 2005.
Besides sea water desalination, Shandong is seeking more fresh water through China's mammoth south-to-north water diversion program and the water diversion program of the Yellow River.
There was enough water in Beijing to adequately supply just over 14 million people in 2005, but the city had 15 million permanent residents and four million migrant workers at the end of last year, Xinhua said recently.
The Chongqing municipal flood control and drought relief office said it planned to ease the drought through artificial rainfall.
Water resource authorities in Hankou, Hubei province, have had to add chlorides to purify drinking water for residents in the city.
"The Yangtze suffers drought almost every spring, but this year's situation is worse than normal," said a sailor, adding the water level at Chaotianmen Wharf in central Chongqing was "lower by at least one meter" compared with last year.
Most areas in China, especially northern areas, will get drier, even though annual rainfall may increase 7 to 10 percent, it said.
The municipal drought control authority has sent water wagons to the drought-hit areas to provide water for humans and cattle and has told local governments to build up reserves.
The total gross domestic product (GDP) of all cities along the Yangtze River accounts for 41 percent of the national total, according to government statistics.

The Yellow River, China's second longest, will see evaporation increase by 15 percent a year, it said.
According to survey by the Jiangxi Bureau of Wildlife Protection, the current number of birds staying by Poyang Lake over winter is about 460,000, down from 730,000 last year.
The annual per capita income of over 50,000 fishermen around Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, was less than 600 yuan (about 77 U.S. dollars), only one fifth of their earning in previous years.
Poyang Lake in east China's Jiangxi Province is a reserve for large flocks of rare migratory birds from north China and Siberia, including white cranes, gray cranes and swans.
Water depth at Yichang and Jingjiang in the middle reaches of the river no longer reaches the navigation standard of 2.9 meters.
"Previously we had to prepare for floods, but the drought has changed all that," said Zhou Jinyun, director of the fishery bureau in the port city of Anqing, in east China's Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the river.
The reduced water flow is affecting the river's capacity to dilute pollutants.
They would recommend that China invest more in research and observation of weather patterns and climate change and promote environmental awareness, Qin said.
China, like the rest of the world, will increasingly face problems of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, drought and more intense typhoons because of the effects of global warming, he said.
Qin's comments come as winter temperatures in China's capital have hit a 30-year high, state media said.
He said the central government had already set a "very ambitious and arduous goal" of reducing carbon dioxide and other emissions by 4 percent a year over the next five years.
However, China has no binding international commitments to reduce its emissions and failed to meet similar targets set by the government five years ago.
Rising temperatures may pose a challenge to the long-term food security of China, the world's most populous country, according to an official report evaluating climate change.
"Glacial melt in about 25 years' time is not going to be there in anything like the capacity that is going to be required.
Experts estimate that the water shortage will not be alleviated until March.
Given the shrinking acreage, falling water tables and a growing population, some grain experts have predicted that China will not be able to raise yields per hectare and the nation will remain a net food importer in the coming years.
Begun in 1993 and costing an estimated 180 billion yuan (23 billion U.S. dollars), the Three Gorges Project on the middle reaches of the river will have 26 generators when it is completed in 2009 and be able to generate 84.7 billion kwh of electricity annually.

Water conservation experts believe most parts of Chongqing will receive between 1,000 and 1,300 millimeters of rainfall this year, slightly more than in recent years.
Last month, state media reported that some regions were suspected of submitting fake data on emissions in 2006.
It said the severe water shortage have led to occasional reports of boats being stranded in shallow water and difficulties in water use for industry, agriculture, and households.
The dam, 2,309 meters long and 185 meters high, was completed in May last year and the water level in the reservoir was raised to 156 meters from 135 meters in October.
The greater demand for water for agriculture will impact the cost of farm produce, it reasoned.
"This is the worst water shortage I've seen in my thirty years experience as a marine worker," said Huang Yongming, head of the Maritime Bureau in the neighboring Tongling city.
The company said the floodgates could maintain the water level at 144 meters.
It also said evaporation rates for some inland rivers would increase by 15 percent.
Low water levels in the river have made it impossible for some fish species to migrate back to the sea, threatening their survival in shallow waters.
It wants to reduce its dependence on coal but converting to cleaner energies on a mass scale would be prohibitively costly for China, which is still a developing economy.
China is the world's biggest consumer and producer of coal, and is expected to surpass the United States as the world's No.
The report was jointly released by six central departments and academic organizations, including the Ministry of Science and Technology, China Meteorological Administration and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The China Daily newspaper said Beijing's temperature hit 12.8 degrees Celsius (55 Fahrenheit) on Saturday  a 30-year high for the date  prompting an early spring, with frozen lakes melting and trees blooming.
1 greenhouse gas emitter in the next decade.
The government will set up consumption quotas and make local officials responsible for managing the use of water, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing the ministry of water resources.
Qingdao, Yantai, Binzhou and a few other cities will benefit from the project, according to the plan.
A British environmental expert said Monday that water shortages in China were already reaching "incredible" proportions, with Shanghai particularly vulnerable unless drastic action is taken quickly.
The local authorities are building weirs to preserve water and provide food for the birds.
Global warming will negatively impact China's ecological, social and economic systems, especially farming, animal husbandry and water supply, and some damage will be irreversible, said the report.
But the declining water level in Chongqing has played havoc with navigation and a cargo ship carrying 1,400 tons of timber was stranded on Sunday close to Chongqing's Xinggang port.
Water flow downstream in Hankou and Datong has also fallen off sharply.
A spokesman of Shapingba Waterworks, one of the largest drinking water suppliers in the city center, told Xinhua that only one of its 10 pipes used to pump water from the Yangtze was still below the water surface and in operation - and that is only 10 cm below the water level.
Wang said they had found some fish, including finless porpoises, maimed by ship propellers and with their skulls shattered.
And when the factories release water back into the river, it is full of pollutants, leading to a series of pollution and chemical accidents in recent years.
