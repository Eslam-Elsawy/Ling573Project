Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
Kelly says he was the victim of identity theft.
More employers are doing background checks on job applicants because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the actions of employees, but also of former employees.
``It's there all the time,'' she said.
Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing crime in America: identity theft.
``We get people's private information, a lot of it,'' she said.
He was never arrested for the crimes committed in his name.
``She even bought a car using my name,'' Frank said.
Then last fall, she said, she watched an NBC News report on how thieves needed only a name and address to steal a person's identity, using that information to set up fraudulent credit accounts.
The group's warning: Be careful about giving out personal information such as Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
 If someone steals your name and runs up lots of bills with it, how do you clear things up?
After his wallet was stolen, he said, a shoplifter who was arrested used Kelly's name and the Los Angeles County Police Department corroborated his account.
Stealing a person's identity requires only a Social Security number and one other piece of identifying information, such as a mother's maiden name.
Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
The changes give consumers more protection by requiring an employer to get applicants' permission before getting credit reports or other background checks on them.
``It cost me my life, really,'' said Kelly, who has since legally changed his name and Social Security number.
His housemate requested and received a copy of Young's birth certificate from Mississippi, then used that document to obtain driver's licenses in Young's name in several states.
Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such as credit-card fraud.
Givens and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private consumer advocacy organization, estimate that up to 350,000 people are victimized by identity theft each year.
``It's a year later and I still can't get a drop of credit,'' he said.
Frank and other experts said that victims of identity theft often become depressed.
Seven years later, he is still fighting to clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
The man covertly copied some of Young's personal information, including his Social Security number and date of birth.
After he found out about the shoplifting report, Kelly sued May and the Stores Protective Association in 1995, complaining that May had failed to correct the report in the association's files even after he had discovered it and provided proof of his innocence.
And if job applicants are turned down because of credit reports, the employer must tell the applicants about that as well as their right to free copies of the reports.
They had another file under the name of a prosecutor who worked their case.
Most of the time you don't know who is doing it, and the perpetrators never get caught.''
I think she's still driving it,'' Frank said.
``It was technology rape,'' she said.
The police said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent paper trails.
Authorities believe that an employee of the insurance company stole her Social Security number.
Givens said one woman was victimized because her health insurance company uses her Social Security number as her member identification.
The man who was Young's housemate for a few months in 1989 had stolen his identity and run up debts around the nation, investigators said.
Officials said increased use of computers, along with the ease of getting a credit card by mail, is responsible for the rise in identity crimes.
Faced with the problem that background checks sometimes turn up inaccurate information, employers have to try to balance their need to screen job applicants with the rights of prospective employees.
``I said: There must be some mistake.
While shredders can help prevent the theft of personal information from garbage, professional thieves often steal things like credit card applications in the mail.
Since many employers do not disclose what sort of background checks they use, it is hard to know exactly how they conduct them.
She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
In 1995, after more than four years, Kelly, now 34, finally discovered the problem: He had been denied employment because of an erroneous shoplifting report circulated to retailers who did background checks on him when he applied for work.
The bank and retail stores will be paying for it.
But she must deal with the headache of clearing up credit reports and changing the account number.
``If people don't know that they have the right to request the details of their own report and the ability to dispute it,'' Ms. Haines said, ``they'll never know why they didn't get a job.''
Two sheets are about as much as it can take before getting stuck.
You should also check your credit report once a year.
Once a thief gets a credit card in someone else's name, it's party time.
Mari Frank, an Orange County attorney who has worked on cases of identity theft, summed up the odyssey of fraud victims:
``A lot of these people don't find out about it until they're getting a house.
Young's housemate was finally arrested.
A Ventura County woman had somehow gotten hold of Frank's Social Security number and other personal data.
``They made master keys to many of the mailboxes in San Francisco ...'' Wismer said.
His housemate asked to see Young's Mississippi driver's license photo.
Westin said background checks were most likely to hurt applicants' chances unfairly when employers conducted hasty checks using sources that were not reliable, many of them inexpensive checking services offered on the Internet.
The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of medical and banking records.
Identity theft is a crime that evolves with every advance in technology.
The police say that as long as credit cards and checks have existed, criminals have used them for fraudulent purposes.
``Many of these guys are into drugs and can't get regular jobs.
``It's a fight for your credit and your sanity,'' Frank said.
Identity theft also became a federal felony this year, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
The person who stole his identity has been arrested several times, the authorities say, but apparently finds Young's name too useful to resist.
 For the last two years, Mari Frank has spent more than 500 hours and $10,000 to clear her name because a Ventura, Calif., woman assumed her identity, stole her credit record and racked up debt along the way.
He had 160 them when the police arrested him last October, including Florida driver's licenses with his picture under more than a dozen different names, none of them his own.
... By the time they clear their credit, they've missed getting the house,'' said Phil Dito, a fraud inspector with the San Francisco police.
``There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud,'' said Young, who lives in Oakland.
``There were 60 or 70 accounts in my name that I had to close,'' Young said.
``In one month, he opened up 40 accounts in my name.
They were able to electronically scan driver's licenses and then change the information and drop in their own photographs, Wismer said.
He recommends that you try to keep private any information like names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names and driver's license numbers.
``I found out more than I ever wanted to know about this.''
It wasn't until two years later that Young realized he'd been had.
Too many IRS employees have access to sensitive computing areas, raising the possibility of information theft.
She shreds the name and address labels that she tears off envelopes and catalogs, along with credit card receipts and credit card applications.
Members of the association, founded in 1929, share information about employees.
But while Kelly had a hard time countering erroneous information that came up in background checks in the early 1990s, people applying for jobs can easily find out now if inaccurate negative information is keeping them from employment, and they can take steps to correct any errors.
It is good for shredding ATM and credit card receipts, but a standard sheet of paper must be folded in half before shredding.
According to a recent report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the Secret Service estimates that $750 million was lost last year from identity theft, up from $450 million in 1996. Credit reporting companies received 523,000 fraud inquiries in 1997, up from 35,000 in 1992.
Until a year ago, there was no legal punishment in California for identity theft.
``I had to write 90 letters and spent 500 hours working to clear my name.''
It's difficult to estimate the actual size of losses incurred by banks and businesses that grant credit, but estimates run up to $4 billion a year, said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer information and advocacy group in San Diego.
``It was so ridiculous, it was laughable,'' she said.
They just go back to what they know best.''
``Now you don't have to go any farther than your desk _ what you can find out today for typically under $100 is incredible.''
``It's like the wild, wild West out there,'' Hendricks said, ``and to protect your privacy you have to be Jesse James.''
Since Strong was victimized, there have been thousands of others, often without any knowledge they are victims.
Typically, one identification card will be used to apply for instant credit at as many as a dozen department stores in a week.
``Every day, charges are being credited to people who have no idea what's really going on.''
Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to others to implement.
``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in America, maybe even the world,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti said at a news conference Wednesday to explain the new law.
Santner and his accomplices applied for credit cards and loans and set up checking accounts.
The impostor opened credit lines at dozens of stores in different areas.
Santner and Shay participated in nearly every form of identity theft, the police said.
The licenses helped Santner and five accomplices scam at least $4 million from businesses and mess up the lives of many innocent people with forged checks and fraudulent credit cards.
In some cases, a criminal will electronically graft his or her photo onto a legally valid driver's license under another person's name with correct information.
Most identity fraud starts small, with a few forged checks or purchases on a stolen credit card.
In the Young case, he could prove that he was at work at a San Francisco bank the day the fraudulent checks were written.
Now, Young always carries copies of letters from the police and credit agencies confirming his identity.
``These guys are artists,'' said San Francisco Police Inspector Earl Wismer.

Kelly's story points to a growing conflict between the rights of employers and employees in an age of quick, easy and inexpensive computer access to public information: how to balance a company's need to know about a person it might hire with the individual's need for privacy.
``And here is the message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you protect the privacy of all Americans.''

If you believe those spaghetti strips could somehow be pieced together, you can spend more for a cross-shredder, which reduces your potentially revealing documents to tiny pieces of paper.
The cards were going to be expensive for users, and devising them had become controversial, so the INS began requiring visas issued by the State Department.
And that has meant a boom for the companies _ especially Web-based services _ that do such searches.
Much of that type of information is now available on the Internet for as little as $15.

At times, she said, that can be a lengthy process.
The more complicated scheme is total identity assumption, where a thief applies for credit cards, loans, utility accounts and apartments under someone else's name.
If she had used the .22 Beretta handgun she had in her possession at the time of her arrest to steal that money, she would still be behind bars.
After spending thousands of dollars, Frank believes she has finally cleared her name with the Bank of New York and other creditors including Thrifty Rental Car, which was threatening to sue her after the impostor trashed a car.
