Former Greco Middle School teacher Debra Lafave, arrested last year amid allegations she had an affair with a student, is scheduled to stand trial in December on two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
The arrest is the second in as many years of a female Hillsborough County teacher accused of having sex with a teenage student.
A female teacher pleaded guilty Tuesday to having sex with a 14-year-old student, avoiding prison as part of a plea agreement.
  Debra Lafave, the former Tampa middle school teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old male student, will avoid prison under a plea deal announced Tuesday.
If I were on a jury and a lawyer argued his client should not go to prison because he or she was beautiful, I would be offended.
Lafave was sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty last month in Hillsborough County to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at her home.
Nearly 18 months after her case sent the tabloids into a tizzy, Lafave, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors in Hillsborough and Marion County.
As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.
A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
"The victim's family indicated they wanted this case over with," Sinacore said.
The former middle school teacher achieved instant notoriety when she was accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.
Lafave, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery, a felony, in exchange for a sentence of three years of community control and seven years of probation.
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was "a fair resolution of this case."
This was someone that he liked," Sinacore said.
Police started investigating Wallace in June, after the student told her mother what was happening, McElroy said.
He does not have to go through depositions and a trial," Fitzgibbons said.
But Judge Hale Stancil wasn't happy with an agreement the Marion County prosecutors reached with defense attorney John Fitzgibbons and asked for some changes, Ridgeway said.
If she is guilty, she should go to prison.
She pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
"What the victim's family said, was every time this came up the boy would get harassed at school," he said.
The victim's mother said after Tuesday's hearing that the public scrutiny had taken its toll on the family.
He also said Lafave told him her marriage was in trouble and that she was aroused by the fact that having sex with him was not allowed.
That plea agreement was supposed to also cover charges in Marion County, where Lafave allegedly had sex with the boy in a sport utility vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove.
Wallace, 28, was charged this week with one count of lewd and lascivious battery, a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
LaFave will plead not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid a trial scheduled for next year, according to her attorney.
"If Debbie was not considered attractive by almost every societal standard," he said, "no one would have been paying any attention to this case."
Ridgeway said the attorneys would take a new plea deal to the judge.
"She (Lafave) has agreed on this plea deal.
She faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.
Under the terms of the deal, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.
If convicted at trial in Hillsborough County, she could have faced up to 15 years in prison on each count.
Debra Lafave, 25, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.
She pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
The girl told detectives she did not want Wallace prosecuted but that she felt guilty about the lies.
The sister told detective Melanee Holder that she found a "love note" from Wallace in the back of her sister's pants pocket in 2003.
The student said Wallace ended the relationship in August 2004 because she wanted to have children and felt guilty about betraying her husband, Craig Wallace, a math teacher and girls soccer coach at Wharton.
"(But) I don't think even (Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons) could anticipate all of the twists and turns and intensity of the media coverage."
"This is a case of someone who has taken advantage of her position to victimize a teenage student," McElroy said of Wallace.
Sent in December 2002, the note initiated 19 months of sexual encounters between teacher Jaymee Wallace and one of her female students, according to police.
The boy told investigators Lafave told him her marriage was in trouble and that she was aroused by the fact that having sex with him was not allowed.
They pulled the plug on prosecution, agreeing Tuesday to a plea deal that will keep the former Greco Middle School teacher out of prison.
"He did not from the get go want to harm Debra Lafave.
Sinacore said he had pressed for three years' prison time during plea negotiations early this year.
"I want to apologize to the court and to the young man involved and his family for my actions.
He reached a deal with Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons shortly before the two were due back in court to argue over a gag order Timmerman imposed last week.
Now classified as a sex offender, Lafave, 25, avoided prison, but she won't be living on Easy Street.
As in the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Washington state school teacher who had a baby with a 13-year-old student, Lafave's case has generated much scrutiny.
If convicted at trial in Hillsborough County, Florida, she could have faced up to 15 years in prison on each count.
Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy, two questions remain.
On Tuesday, a judge sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.
The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two counties.
Debra Lafave, 25, whose sensational case made tabloid headlines, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.
In August, the student's mother gave police notes she found, addressed to her daughter from fellow students.
By the spring of 2003, they were having oral sex in the coach's apartment and in parking lots around the city, the student told detectives.
No matter where she goes, life will not be the same for Debra Lafave.
Most importantly he can go on with his."
Fitzgibbons said in July that plea negotiations had broken off because prosecutors insisted on prison time, which he said would be too dangerous for someone as attractive as Lafave.
"It allows the young man involved here to go on with his life, just as Debbie can go on with her life.
As long as he doesn't try to argue that she's too pretty.
LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.
The former Greco Middle School reading teacher apologized during the hearing, saying "I accept full responsibility for my actions."
Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity defense.
/BThis brings us to Debra Lafave, B /I/Bthe former (definitely former) instructor at Greco Middle School in Hillsborough County, who faces felony charges alleging, shall we say, improper conduct (definitely improper) with a teenage boy.
PETER : But people were in front of me.
"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult for the victims' family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move.
On Jan. 21, 2003, the student wrote that she "wanted to do more than just write notes," according to detectives.
"It would come out and be written about again and again and again in all of the media.
"I really don't want to get into the details, but that could be a concern if people know where she lives."
The victim's mother said this didn't happen," said school district spokesman Stephen Hegarty.
The victim's mother said afterward that the public scrutiny had taken its toll on the family, and they just wanted to see it all end.
"If you had to sit back and just from a societal point of view, (ask) what impact does the media have by putting such focus on this case when a young boy is going to be affected, that's the balancing act."
But prosecutor Ric Ridgeway said his office wants to speak with the boy's family first.
She can begin going on with her life.
"We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer," said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.
If that doesn't work, Fitzgibbons still will be entitled to argue that whatever pressures Lafave felt should be considered as mitigating circumstances to keep her out of prison.
But the judge in one of the counties has balked, Ric Ridgeway, a spokesman for the State Attorney's Office, said Thursday.
Lafave will also be barred from seeking employment in places near children.
If she successfully completes her first two years on house arrest, also known as community control, a judge could waive her last year of home confinement.
The student was 15, a rising star on the girls basketball team that Wallace coached.
They arm-wrestled, the student told detectives.
The student told detectives the note from Wallace came tucked inside an envelope, clipped to a graded paper Wallace handed her in math class.
Like Lafave, Wallace was newly married at the time of the alleged encounters.
It was my feeling that any juror who listened to the testimony of all the difficulties Debbie has gone through would have found it a very sad and compelling story," Fitzgibbons said.
But Fitzgibbons said the temporary ruling would not have stopped the runaway train of attention aimed at the client he once hinted was too pretty for prison.
"My prayer is that he can leave this behind him and go on and be a happy, healthy young man."
"My prayer is that he can leave this behind him and go on and be a happy, healthy young man."
Lafave apologized during the hearing Tuesday, saying that "I accept full responsibility for my actions."
The biggest complication for Lafave could be a requirement that she place her name on the state's sex offender registry.
"In years past, generally, defense lawyers would have little or no comment (on high-profile cases)," Fitzgibbons said.
"Now, as she begins to look for work and a job, that's going to be a problem because wherever she works, she's going to be the center of attention."
This week, talks over a plea deal between Lafave and prosecutors broke down, and her trial was rescheduled for December.
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave also will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
Now classified as a sex offender, the former teacher can no longer work with or near children and cannot live within 1,000 feet of a school, church or playground.

In the end, the boy's mother decided not to gamble on a trial and to save her son the humiliation.
I don't think Debbie could survive it.
The victim's mother said the boy is "well-adjusted" and shows no signs of having been traumatized.
Fitzgibbons said the judge indicated that he wanted to hear expert information about a trial's potential impact on the two boys involved.
Although the teenager had agreed to detail the relationship on the witness stand, it was unclear how his testimony about his feelings for Lafave might impact a jury, Sinacore said.
The case attracted national attention, and her lawyer had rejected an earlier plea arrangement that called for three years in prison, saying Lafave was too attractive to survive in jail.
Hegarty said she was transferred to the school district's Office of Professional Standards, where she has no contact with students.
A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was sane when she had sex with the boy.
She is accused of the same crime as many a male teacher who has abused his position of authority and trust.
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
The boy told investigators he and Lafave had sex in a classroom at the school, located in Temple Terrace near Tampa, in her Riverview town house and once in a vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove them around.
The last-minute move spared Lafave the possibility of as much as 30 years in prison and saved her victim, who was 14 when the sexual encounters occurred, from the crush of a media frenzy.
The plea agreement also was designed to resolve similar charges in Marion County, where Lafave was scheduled to appear in court Dec. 8.

"She goes to the mall, and people point to her, and people come up to her," Fitzgibbons said.
She joked with some players that Craig Wallace, 28, was suspicious of her relationship with team members, former student and player Nikki Kelley told police.

All along her attorney has turned the spotlight to his advantage.
Details of Lafave's past and the student's experiences with her became clearer Tuesday afternoon after the State Attorney's Office released hundreds of pages of documents that could have been aired at trial.
"If we had continued along this path, this would have followed him forever," said the mother, whose name was being withheld to protect her son's identity.
"If we had continued along this path, this would have followed him forever," said the mother, whose name was being withheld to protect her son's identity.
On Tuesday, the victim was set to answer attorney questions at a formal deposition.
"I couldn't imagine sitting there and looking at my son and then looking at him surrounded by the whole courtroom as well as looking at Lafave talking about things that shouldn't have happened to him," the mother said.
Her name is being withheld to protect her son's identity.
"If somebody successfully makes it through sex offender probation, they probably deserve a break," he said after Tuesday's sentencing.
 With just a week to go before trial, the glare of celebrity had not dimmed.
Fitzgibbons declined to comment directly on how the media might have impacted the family.
"She is a sexual offender and if it were a male she would have definitely gotten jail time," he told CBS's "The Early Show."
I accept full responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry," Lafave said.
The lawyer might have tried to argue that Lafave's crimes were not worthy of prison (good luck with that).
He might have argued that mitigating factors, whatever they are, should spare her from incarceration.
Last month, a Hillsborough judge said she will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
But whether deliberate or automatic, Fitzgibbons' argument was precisely that Lafave should not be subjected to prison because she is beautiful.
Several tense minutes later, the plea deal was announced.
The boy told investigators the two had sex in a classroom at the school, located in Temple Terrace near Tampa, in her Riverview town house and once in a vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove them around Marion County.

Some supported Fitzgibbons' claims about her battle with mental illness and the trauma she suffered when she was raped at 13.
Founder of the university's Sexual Disorders Clinic, Berlin said that Lafave, like most female offenders, is unlikely to repeat her behavior, but her battle with mental illness and the scrutiny of her case will present extra challenges.
"When people report on male pedophiles, words are tossed around like "predator' or "mental illness.'

Kansas State University professor Bob Shoop, an expert witness in cases involving sexual abuse between teachers and students, said students usually don't report the incidents.
"That's my goal, to keep him whole," the boy's mother said in an interview with WTVT-Ch.
The papers include interviews with Lafave's former husband, Kristian Owen Lafave, 27, as well as a woman she dated in high school and a co-worker.
"The student feels this is a real relationship," Shoop said, speaking generally.
Finally, the boy's family could take no more.
But his most surprising supporters are the victims' relatives, who think this was all a tragic accident, not a crime.
LaFave was arrested in June and suspended from her job until the trial is over.
Lafave's ex-husband, Owen Lafave, said Wednesday that she was being treated for mental problems when she committed the crime, but it was a double standard that she avoided prison.
Prosecutors released photographs taken in a department store where they said the teacher had taken the youth, supposedly the day his relatives began to suspect that there was something between the two.
Fitzgibbons intends to raise an insanity defense.
As a sex offender, Lafave is barred from living within 1,000 feet of a school, a playground or other areas where children gather.
He nearly lost that strategic edge last week when Timmerman issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from talking publicly about Lafave.
