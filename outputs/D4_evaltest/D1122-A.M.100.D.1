At least three people were killed in the the collapse of a bridge Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota that sent cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River, officials said.
Several cars were flung into the river and there was no immediate news on how many people were hurt or killed.
A school bus loaded with 60 children with a church group could be seen on the bridge but did not fall into the river as it collapsed.
One of the workers was unaccounted for, he said.
"There are no indications of a nexus to terrorism at this time.
