At least three people were killed in the the collapse of a bridge Wednesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota that sent cars and trucks tumbling into the Mississippi River, officials said.
A school bus loaded with 60 children with a church group could be seen on the bridge but did not fall into the river as it collapsed.
In 2005, the 40-year-old bridge had been rated as "structurally deficient" and possibly in need of replacement, according to a federal database.
Several cars were flung into the river and there was no immediate news on how many people were hurt or killed.
