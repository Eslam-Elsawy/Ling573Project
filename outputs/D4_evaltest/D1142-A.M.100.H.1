There were no claims of responsibility, which is typical of terrorist attacks in India.
Seven near-simultaneous bomb blasts tore through crowded markets in the Indian tourist city of Jaipur Tuesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding 200 in what police said was a terror attack.
Serial blasts rocked crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled tourist city.
Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the terrorist blasts, which killed at least 60 people and injured 150 others in Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan state Tuesday evening, the NDTV reported.
