Santander may face $3.1 billion in losses through its Optimal Investment Services, a Geneva-based fund of hedge funds that is owned by the bank.
On Thursday, Madoff was charged with securities fraud after confessing to his sons that his business was a Ponzi scheme, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is the second private Swiss bank to acknowledge having investments in funds managed by Madoff.
Madoff eventually attracted billions of dollars from investors.
The bank said it had also invested 17 million euros of its own funds in Madoff products.
