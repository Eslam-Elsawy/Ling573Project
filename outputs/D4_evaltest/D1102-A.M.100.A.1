Cluley said three of the 13 domain name system servers that control global Internet traffic were hit with a so-called "denial of service" attack, which means they were bombarded with information requests in an effort to bring them down.
The attack was on three of the 13 Internet root servers, which manage the domains from various locations around the world and convert website names such as Amazon.com to their numeric IP address.
Experts said at the time that the Internet would still operate with at least one of the servers functioning.
