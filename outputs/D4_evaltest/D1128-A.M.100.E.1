Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will not be ready for the start of his trial in June on charges of overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in West Africa, his lawyer told a judge Friday.

The former warlord-turned-president has been indicted by the United Nations- backed Special Court for Sierra Leone on charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international human rights.

Last week, Taylor's lawyers told the court they needed more time to prepare his defense.

The trial is expected to start June 4 in The Hague, Netherlands.
