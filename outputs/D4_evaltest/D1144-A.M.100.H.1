The latest recall, announced last week, involves 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and rail sets or about 4 percent of all those sold in the United States over the last two years which were coated at a factory in China with potentially poisonous lead paint.

The company said it does not use the same factories as RC2 and its toys do not have lead paint.

About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.

A total of 1.5 million toys were recalled worldwide.
