Thursday's toy recall follows the June recall by RC2 Corp. of 1.5 million wooden railroad toys and set parts from its Thomas Friends Wooden Railway product line because of lead paint.
The latest recall, announced last week, involves 1.5 million Thomas and Friends trains and rail sets or about 4 percent of all those sold in the United States over the last two years which were coated at a factory in China with potentially poisonous lead paint.
About 60 percent of all product recalls this year have been for goods manufactured in China, according to the safety commission.
