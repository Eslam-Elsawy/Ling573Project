"When these same Parkinson's patients take their dopamine medication, they show the reverse pattern, learning better from positive feedback and worse from negative feedback than controls," said the University of Colorado research team. Cures for these and other diseases, many scientists now believe, could come from research into human embryonic stem cells. So far, the government has awarded about $35 million for human embryonic stem cell research. The debate centers on whether the embryos used in stem cell research are human beings. The Bush campaign called the ad false.
