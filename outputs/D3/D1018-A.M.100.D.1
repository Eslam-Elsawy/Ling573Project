A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.
Joran remains in police custody with two other young men in the May 30 disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18.
