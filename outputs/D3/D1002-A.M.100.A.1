The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their case.
The defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired.
``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four accused of second-degree murder.
