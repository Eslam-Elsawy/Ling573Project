The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs, salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds.
The first vertebrate species to begin hopping and crawling on land 350 million years ago may be the first to die out, according to a study released Thursday that found a third of all amphibian species worldwide are threatened with extinction.
``Nearly one-third of all the species are in the three top categories of endangerment, and nearly half the declines for unknown causes.''
