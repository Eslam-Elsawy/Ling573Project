(AP) -- The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
Both Henderson and McKinney are accused of first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in an attack that led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the country.
