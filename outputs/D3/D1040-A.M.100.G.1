The prosecutor said that in the story Cole McLarty stated that Blake had talked of Bakley and "he didn't like Bonny, didn't approve of her lifestyle and wanted her out of the way."
Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.
The testimony sought to shore up the account of Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited them to kill his wife.
And Blake's case has an added problem.
