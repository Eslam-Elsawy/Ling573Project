About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.
He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons.
He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in the plant.
``We have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial medicines, he said.
Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents.
