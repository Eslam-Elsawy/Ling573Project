Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
