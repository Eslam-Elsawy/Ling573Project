Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
Although the police chief and district attorney both have said that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they have not formally named any suspects.
In two separate letters, they accuse Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter of unwarranted delays in prosecuting the case and of being overly accommodating to the Ramseys.
The Ramseys have proclaimed their innocence.
