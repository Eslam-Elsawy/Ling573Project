norwegian oil group statoil on tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the north sea that were shut down last november due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term. the shutdown of snorre and production in the nearby vigdis field cut norway's production by 205,000 barrels of oil a day, or 6.4 percent of the nation's roughly 3.2 million barrel daily production. "at the moment it is unclear when production from snorre a and vigdis will resume," statoil said in a statement.
