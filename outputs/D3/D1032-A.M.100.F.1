Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea. Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day. Until repairs are completed production has been halted on the Snorre A platform, causing losses of 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) and on neighboring platform Vigdis, entailing losses of 75,000 bpd. "At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis will resume," Statoil said in a statement. Reinertsen described the incident as "serious and rare".
