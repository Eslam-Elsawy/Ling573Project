LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.
"She goes to the mall, and people point to her, and people come up to her," Fitzgibbons said.
In the end, the boy's mother decided not to gamble on a trial and to save her son the humiliation.
As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition.
