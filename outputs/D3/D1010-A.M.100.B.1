It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
