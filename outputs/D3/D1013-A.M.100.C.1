Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
When errors in records are found, said Deirdre Mulligan, a staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, ``the only way to correct records is to go back to the original source of the information.''
Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
``It was technology rape,'' she said.
