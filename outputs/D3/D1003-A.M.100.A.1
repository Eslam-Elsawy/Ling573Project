The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said.
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan home to 76 percent of them, according to the State Forestry Administration.
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China.
As of late last year, the flowering bamboo covered more than 7, 000 hectares of the nature preserve.
And the blooming area has continued to expand.
