Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.
Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon within the next three months and called on the international community to intervene to help "this captive nation."
He was Rafik Hariri, a former and a future prime minister of Lebanon.
Over the years, Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian influence in Lebanon, a product of Syria's military and intelligence presence left over from the war.
