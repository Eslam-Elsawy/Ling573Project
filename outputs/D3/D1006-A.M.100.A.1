the announcement comes just two weeks after merck pulled its painkiller, vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken vioxx for 18 months or longer.gilmartin was clear that the trial should be halted and that the drug might have to be taken off the market.vioxx was approved after trials held under the auspices of the food and drug administration showed it to be effective (which it was).the drug was not pulled at that point.
