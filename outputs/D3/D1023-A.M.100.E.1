The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where two people were killed and two survivors were pulled from the snow and debris.
Maj. Thomas Schoenherr, an Austrian military spokesman, said rescuers in Galtuer had no way of making their way down the valley Wednesday afternoon to help after the most recent avalanche in Ischgl, but that others had been flown in by helicopter.
He said 31 people were still missing in the village in the Tyrol province, near the Swiss border.
Walter said that in some parts of the village, snow was 17 feet high.
