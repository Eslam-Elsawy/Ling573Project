``It's there all the time,'' she said.
Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
More employers are doing background checks on job applicants because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the actions of employees, but also of former employees.
Kelly says he was the victim of identity theft.
Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
If she had used the .22 Beretta handgun she had in her possession at the time of her arrest to steal that money, she would still be behind bars.
Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing crime in America: identity theft.
``We get people's private information, a lot of it,'' she said.
LOS ANGELES _ For the last two years, Mari Frank has spent more than 500 hours and $10,000 to clear her name because a Ventura, Calif., woman assumed her identity, stole her credit record and racked up debt along the way.
She said she was now eligible to reapply to Good Guys.
The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 makes it a felony to commit identity theft.
He was never arrested for the crimes committed in his name.
After his wallet was stolen, he said, a shoplifter who was arrested used Kelly's name and the Los Angeles County Police Department corroborated his account.
She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
And if job applicants are turned down because of credit reports, the employer must tell the applicants about that as well as their right to free copies of the reports.
``If people don't know that they have the right to request the details of their own report and the ability to dispute it,'' Ms. Haines said, ``they'll never know why they didn't get a job.''
``Now you don't have to go any farther than your desk _ what you can find out today for typically under $100 is incredible.''
``And here is the message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you protect the privacy of all Americans.''
She shreds the name and address labels that she tears off envelopes and catalogs, along with credit card receipts and credit card applications.
I think she's still driving it,'' Frank said.
``It's a year later and I still can't get a drop of credit,'' he said.
In the Young case, he could prove that he was at work at a San Francisco bank the day the fraudulent checks were written.
Givens said one woman was victimized because her health insurance company uses her Social Security number as her member identification.
``She even bought a car using my name,'' Frank said.
... By the time they clear their credit, they've missed getting the house,'' said Phil Dito, a fraud inspector with the San Francisco police.
Then last fall, she said, she watched an NBC News report on how thieves needed only a name and address to steal a person's identity, using that information to set up fraudulent credit accounts.
Ms. Harris enjoys her Royal shredder so much that she bought a shredder for each of her four children, and she plans to take her shredder back home to Harrisburg, Pa., in the fall and use it there for the rest of the year.
She did not get the job because of the results of a criminal records check in California conducted by the Amherst Group on behalf of Good Guys, she said.
``It was so ridiculous, it was laughable,'' she said.
Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such as credit-card fraud.
After he found out about the shoplifting report, Kelly sued May and the Stores Protective Association in 1995, complaining that May had failed to correct the report in the association's files even after he had discovered it and provided proof of his innocence.
Lawrence said, ``Employers are frustrated because they can't always get the specific information they need to make a hiring decision.''
You also can have your credit report blocked, to be released only when you call in with your personal identification number, Mierzwinski said.
``First you get victimized by the bad guy, then you get victimized by the banks that won't believe you, then you get victimized by the credit reporting agencies that won't take off the fraudulent information and then you are victimized by another company that won't give you credit, then you are victimized by government agencies that won't believe you,'' Frank said.
``This is not the way the IBMs of the world check up on people,'' Westin said.
They just go back to what they know best.''
The police say that as long as credit cards and checks have existed, criminals have used them for fraudulent purposes.
Two sheets are about as much as it can take before getting stuck.
Stealing a person's identity requires only a Social Security number and one other piece of identifying information, such as a mother's maiden name.
Much of that type of information is now available on the Internet for as little as $15.
His housemate requested and received a copy of Young's birth certificate from Mississippi, then used that document to obtain driver's licenses in Young's name in several states.
Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to tighten the security of financial and medical records and to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
Authorities believe that an employee of the insurance company stole her Social Security number.
The man covertly copied some of Young's personal information, including his Social Security number and date of birth.
Frank and other experts said that victims of identity theft often become depressed.
Faced with the problem that background checks sometimes turn up inaccurate information, employers have to try to balance their need to screen job applicants with the rights of prospective employees.
``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in America, maybe even the world,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti said at a news conference Wednesday to explain the new law.
In 1995, after more than four years, Kelly, now 34, finally discovered the problem: He had been denied employment because of an erroneous shoplifting report circulated to retailers who did background checks on him when he applied for work.
According to a recent report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the Secret Service estimates that $750 million was lost last year from identity theft, up from $450 million in 1996. Credit reporting companies received 523,000 fraud inquiries in 1997, up from 35,000 in 1992.
``It was technology rape,'' she said.
From 1991 to 1993, Young worked to clear his name, writing more than 100 letters and checking his credit report regularly.
You should also check your credit report once a year.
``They made master keys to many of the mailboxes in San Francisco ...'' Wismer said.
Westin said background checks were most likely to hurt applicants' chances unfairly when employers conducted hasty checks using sources that were not reliable, many of them inexpensive checking services offered on the Internet.
Every day during the summer, Ms. Harris, 65, opens her mail on the sun porch of her summer cottage in Buchanan, N.Y. She sorts it, then shreds what she doesn't need in her $29 Royal Jaws personal shredder, which sits on top of her wastebasket.
Since many employers do not disclose what sort of background checks they use, it is hard to know exactly how they conduct them.
While shredders can help prevent the theft of personal information from garbage, professional thieves often steal things like credit card applications in the mail.
The man who was Young's housemate for a few months in 1989 had stolen his identity and run up debts around the nation, investigators said.
Marvin Young's case began in 1989, shortly after he moved to the San Francisco from Mississippi.
The police said Santner had masterminded the biggest identity theft scam ever seen in San Francisco, with a ring of thieves who took names and Social Security numbers of other people and then created fraudulent paper trails.
Choosing among personal shredders depends upon how you intend to use the machine and, more important, how much security you feel you need.
``And then she didn't keep up her payments.
After spending thousands of dollars, Frank believes she has finally cleared her name with the Bank of New York and other creditors including Thrifty Rental Car, which was threatening to sue her after the impostor trashed a car.
Officials said increased use of computers, along with the ease of getting a credit card by mail, is responsible for the rise in identity crimes.
``He was quiet until August of 1997, then he went on a rampage,'' Young said.
Seven years later, he is still fighting to clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
Santner is a chilling example of one of the fastest-growing crimes in the world.
``We think the trend is up, up, up.''
Mari Frank, an Orange County attorney who has worked on cases of identity theft, summed up the odyssey of fraud victims:
``I am the true, real Mari Frank and it was not very easy to prove that,'' she said.
She drove home from the courthouse in the same red convertible Mustang that she bought with my name.''
She was given a copy of the report, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so she disputed the errors, which were corrected.
A Democratic senator _ it's unknown who it was _ placed a hold on the popular measure, which for the first time makes identity theft a crime.
But job applicants do have rights, especially under amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that took effect on Sept. 30, 1997, extending the protection of the rules governing credit reports to job applicants.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Marvin Young Jr. got home from work one evening and found a certified letter from the Sacramento police that changed his life.
The changes in the law also make it easier for job applicants to correct any errors found.
Identity theft also became a federal felony this year, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Santner and Shay participated in nearly every form of identity theft, the police said.
``A lot of these people don't find out about it until they're getting a house.
Kyl, along with Rep. Jim Kolbe and other members of the delegation, is also involved in trying to straighten out the border crossing-card issue.
SAN FRANCISCO _ If someone steals your name and runs up lots of bills with it, how do you clear things up?
``In one month, he opened up 40 accounts in my name.
... Bills in my name were being sent to Ventura (Calif.).
The licenses helped Santner and five accomplices scam at least $4 million from businesses and mess up the lives of many innocent people with forged checks and fraudulent credit cards.
Most of the time you don't know who is doing it, and the perpetrators never get caught.''
Typically, one identification card will be used to apply for instant credit at as many as a dozen department stores in a week.
His housemate asked to see Young's Mississippi driver's license photo.
``It cost me my life, really,'' said Kelly, who has since legally changed his name and Social Security number.
A Ventura County woman had somehow gotten hold of Frank's Social Security number and other personal data.
Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
If you believe those spaghetti strips could somehow be pieced together, you can spend more for a cross-shredder, which reduces your potentially revealing documents to tiny pieces of paper.
The new law is the latest in a series of recent local and federal guidelines set up to protect Americans from the misappropriation of a name, Social Security number, driver's license or any other form of identification for monetary gain.
``In this labor market, you have to act quickly or you'll lose applicants to competitors,'' he added.
I realized that there needed to be a group for us.''
That's the insidious nature of this _ there's often no way to know for sure.''
It wasn't until two years later that Young realized he'd been had.
The problems have increased with the growth of online background-checking services.
Since Strong was victimized, there have been thousands of others, often without any knowledge they are victims.
It took Mari Frank two years and became an obsession.
``I thought, well, if I've got to tear up envelopes and anything with names and addresses, that's a lot'' to do by hand or with scissors, she said.
But one thing is sure: The scrutiny of job applicants has intensified in recent years, as incidents of workplace violence, and the number of lawsuits charging employers with negligence in hiring, have increased, employment experts say.
When errors in records are found, said Deirdre Mulligan, a staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, ``the only way to correct records is to go back to the original source of the information.''
Fear of so-called identity fraud _ said to be the nation's fastest-growing type of consumer fraud _ is reason enough for some people to buy shredders, said Todd W. Henreckson, director of the General Binding Corp.'s Shredmaster division, in Northbrook, Ill.
Identity theft is a crime that evolves with every advance in technology.
Once a thief gets a credit card in someone else's name, it's party time.
The report had been forwarded by one of the stores to which he had applied _ Robinsons-May _ through its parent company, the May Department Stores, to the Stores Protective Association, a nonprofit group in Simi Valley, Calif., that provides background screening, work histories and loss-prevention programs to about 100 retail chains, manufacturers and other businesses.
``There were 60 or 70 accounts in my name that I had to close,'' Young said.
--Employees without a need to know have the ability to change or delete taxpayer information.
Young's housemate was finally arrested.
``It's a fight for your credit and your sanity,'' Frank said.
Givens and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private consumer advocacy organization, estimate that up to 350,000 people are victimized by identity theft each year.
But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to many in Congress and to public-interest groups.
Now, Young always carries copies of letters from the police and credit agencies confirming his identity.
``These guys are artists,'' said San Francisco Police Inspector Earl Wismer.
He recommends that you try to keep private any information like names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, mothers' maiden names and driver's license numbers.
The group's warning: Be careful about giving out personal information such as Social Security numbers and bank account numbers.
_That will help you decide how many sheets you want the machine to handle at once.
Sobel also said the proposals ``still leave us out of step with Europe.''
Until a year ago, there was no legal punishment in California for identity theft.
It is hard to lift the shredder on and off the wastebasket it comes with.
In a written response, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said he agreed with many of the conclusions and GAO recommendations, but he insisted that the agency is well on the way to a more complete turnaround.
A 1994 survey of 589 members of the American Management Association in New York found that 70 percent conducted background checks on applicants and 48 percent searched criminal records.
When he was unable to get work, he ended up filing for bankruptcy and became homeless for a time.
DOES IT MATTER WHICH TYPE OF CUT THE SHREDDER MAKES?
But while Kelly had a hard time countering erroneous information that came up in background checks in the early 1990s, people applying for jobs can easily find out now if inaccurate negative information is keeping them from employment, and they can take steps to correct any errors.
After Frank found out about the crime, the Laguna Niguel, Calif., lawyer spent hundreds of hours talking on the phone and writing letters before her record was clean.
Santner stayed in the city for two years, even after coming to the attention of investigators in 1995.
Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to others to implement.
Lawrence, of the Society for Human Resource Management, said: ``Employers can have all that data and still not take away a sense of how a person will perform in the job.''
The IRS says it has corrected 75 percent of the problems identified in that report.
Once the shredder sticks, you have to use the reverse and forward buttons to free the paper.
The police said the suspects had stolen ID cards and checks, altered them with state-of-the-art desktop publishing equipment and reprinted the bogus cards on a color printer.
With the long, thin strips, your wastebasket is likely to fill up quickly (a plus if you need packing material).
Most frustrating for Rep. John Shadegg is the hold the Senate placed on his and Kyl's identity-theft bill, which was passed after an Arizona couple spent $15,000 and countless hours trying to restore their good name after a thief destroyed it.
They were able to electronically scan driver's licenses and then change the information and drop in their own photographs, Wismer said.
Kelly's story points to a growing conflict between the rights of employers and employees in an age of quick, easy and inexpensive computer access to public information: how to balance a company's need to know about a person it might hire with the individual's need for privacy.
I'd never even stopped there before.''
The bank and retail stores will be paying for it.
The person who stole his identity has been arrested several times, the authorities say, but apparently finds Young's name too useful to resist.
I'd never even been to Sacramento.''
``In a day and age where it's hard to find qualified employees, you really don't want to turn people away if there's not a real good reason for doing so,'' said Barry Lawrence, a spokesman for the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.
``They mastered every aspect of this crime,'' Wismer said.
``It's like the wild, wild West out there,'' Hendricks said, ``and to protect your privacy you have to be Jesse James.''
``But it tends to be the impression many employees have.
``The police just don't have time to really go after these problems,'' said Joanne Mankiewicz of San Francisco, whose name was used to amass $80,000 in debt.
Few scam artists are as sophisticated as Santner, a former chef with a knack for computers, and Shay, a former employee of the credit reporting agency TRW (now known as Experian) who is familiar with consumer databases.
More public records have been placed on the Internet in recent years as information brokers have linked with public agencies, governments and businesses for computer access that enables them to compile virtual dossiers on anyone, including data like Social Security numbers, property ownership, driving records and nearest relatives.
In the case, a Kmart employee was accused of rape by an employee of Flor-Shin, the company the retailer had hired to clean floors.

The GAO credited the Internal Revenue Service with making some major leaps forward in improving computer security since another critical audit in April 1997.
Mathiason cautioned, ``Electronic information can be wrong and to rely upon it blindly is unwise.''
They share frustration over an economic system that grants credit easily and a criminal justice establishment that puts a low priority on prosecuting fraud.
While consumers usually aren't charged for the fraud, it does tangle up their credit records, Givens said.
The popularity of personal shredders has increased tremendously in the past few years, said Jean Papagni, a Staples spokeswoman.

The report, which focused chiefly on nursing-home practices, calls for a national registry of workers with criminal backgrounds that would be accessible to employers.
Thirty-three states now require criminal background checks for workers in positions like health care, child care, schools and housekeeping.
The buyers of small shredders include schools, people working at home and professionals like lawyers, doctors and tax preparers.
Shredders appeal to people like Carol Story, a member of a co-op board on the New York's Upper West Side who plans to ask the board to buy one.

Credit card theft had been the realm of pickpockets for decades.
Employers do background checks in various ways _ using the telephone, fax or Internet, for example.
The changes give consumers more protection by requiring an employer to get applicants' permission before getting credit reports or other background checks on them.
Now, a new breed of high-tech thieves can steal a whole identity and run up charges in the name, sometimes for years, without the victim's knowledge.
Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, a newsletter based in Washington, said shredding documents was smart because ``identity theft is a growing problem to the extent of becoming a national epidemic.''
Strong and other victims have testified for legislation to make it easier to clean up credit and get tougher on perpetrators.
Last week, a couple masquerading as her company's business associates passed phony corporate checks with her husband's forged signature in laser printing.
``There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud,'' said Young, who lives in Oakland.

Just the thought of someone rifling through their garbage is motivation enough for many people to buy shredders.
Penalties will include prison sentences of up to three years and fines up to $10,000.
``I'm having trouble explaining who I am _ he took over my life,'' Young said.
``Identity thefts are overwhelming credit bureaus, postal inspectors and the Secret Service,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, speaking on behalf of the California Public Interest Group.

``They even had a postal uniform.''
It's difficult to estimate the actual size of losses incurred by banks and businesses that grant credit, but estimates run up to $4 billion a year, said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer information and advocacy group in San Diego.

But they found much of their treasure in the trash can.
Congress required the Immigration and Naturalization Service to change border crossing cards _ identification cards used by frequent border crossers _ to make them more fraud-resistant.
The police broke the Santner ring because its leader liked San Francisco too much, said Wismer, who spent more than two years pursuing its leader.
