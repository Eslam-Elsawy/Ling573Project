The "provisional" designation highlights the need for more research into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.
Dr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said the study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue to the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.
For Hecht, the eating disorders were part of her life for many years, but she didn't admit it to herself, and others, until the mid-1990s.
She has held down a number of different jobs and is convinced she can best help her clients, who often come in groups, like the members of the "Dick und duenn", or the Fat and Thin, association.
"The Future of EDNOS" was a topic at an international meeting on eating disorders in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last month, and it is the title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.
An excruciating feature of the disorder is that it can seem to unfold in slow motion in front of friends and family as the sufferer gets progressively thinner.
"The materials are designed to be available to the kids so that they can pick one up and they don't have to talk to anybody," she said.
"The payoff for someone who hosts a site is that it encourages them to stay with their program," says Vivian Meehan, founder of the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.
When she reached 118, she was in the grasp of the disease.
While several factors contributed to Emma's anorexia, she knows that for the three months prior to her hospitalization, the pro-Ana sites were instrumental in worsening her condition.
Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and treatment that they need.
She was fascinated by the discussion groups and the links to get more information.
"Not many therapists want to deal with it because eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, and the patients are extremely difficult to work with."
The sites have been around for more than two years and are the targets of groups such as the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.
She has written hundreds of letters, including one to first lady Laura Bush that led to Montaner's being appointed to the adolescent health committee for the Texas Department of Health.
So far the insurance lobby has blocked attempts to have anorexia and bulimia added to the list of serious mental illnesses that insurance companies are mandated to cover, which includes schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
The image haunted her so much that she mustered the courage during a semester abroad to write to her friend.
Dr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the University of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers testing the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat the convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge eating.
According to research done by The Renfrew Center in Philadelphia, the country's first free-standing and largest treatment facility for eating disorders, the age distribution has changed: 23.5 percent of the women treated at Renfrew are now over 35.
"In the coming years, we will certainly have to face the problem of anorexia and bulimia," in Italian children.
The strong-willed girl was confident this summer, cocky even, that she was going to walk out of the hospital and get better through an outpatient program.
Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a condition that has been labeled "purging disorder" by Dr. Pamela Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.
Dr. William Schlaff, president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility and a professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said the study was "very nicely designed" and had made an "important first observation" that needed further study.
In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994, one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and listed as a "provisional diagnostic category," the first step in the process of achieving its own diagnosis.
The eating disorders association cautions not to worsen the situation with admonitions like "You just need to eat!"
Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the same edition.
To date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating disorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2 percent of the population who suffer from it.
The stress led her to control the one thing she could -- her body.
Dr. Barbara Corkey, president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and a professor of medicine and biochemistry at Boston University, said the study had found a "creative use of leptin," but she wasn't surprised.
The owner of "Sehnsucht", or Nostalgia, in the German capital's Tiergarten quarter is Katja Eichbaum, and she too has come a long way back from the brink.
Friends and family need to realize that an anorexic looking in the mirror does not see the same emaciated figure they do.
As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in a kind of therapeutic limbo.
Researchers in the new study, which was funded by institutional grants and Amgen, the developer of a drug based on the hormone, began looking at people who may not have enough leptin because of low body fat.
Montaner established the nonprofit Lifelines Foundation for Eating Disorders with the goal of establishing the first acute-care facility in Texas dedicated solely to treating eating disorders.
"One of the hallmarks of the illness is denial of the illness," Bunnell said.
The causes of the disorder are still unknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have a history of depression.
She took dinner to her room and flushed it down the toilet.
Now, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for greater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is generating much attention.
She said the mixed eating disorder label "may have the benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow less severe or less clinically significant than so-called full-threshold eating disorders."
Sites with names such as "House of Sins," "Starving for Perfection" and "Bare to the Bones" convinced Emma that starvation was fulfilling.
The answer, she believes, is to become mindful of every moment.
And the toll of the disease, which is defined as a mental illness, goes beyond the emotional and physical effects felt by one person.
Montaner said she sat in horror as her daughter detailed how easy it was to eat between classes at school, then go to the bathroom after class started and force herself to vomit.
Her favorite pastime is to sit in front of the television with a gallon of mocha-chip ice cream.
The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise Specified category is the trickiest to meet.
Meehan, of the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, says the campaign to pull down sites promoting anorexia will continue.
Montaner is trying to raise the estimated $40,000 needed to get the items distributed.
She got on the Internet and scored multiple hits when she typed in the appropriate search words.
"The more you can slow down and pay attention, the fuller you will feel, and you won't have to be turning to food or alcohol."
The association has had limited success in persuading Internet providers to shut down the sites because they can be harmful to minors, but the sites reappear through other providers.
The guilt of possibly failing in her mission to lose weight drove her to stay focused.
It became clear, she says, that she wasn't going to be able to achieve the way she had in high school.
First is a member of the planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of revising the manual for its fifth edition.
The new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge eaters from around the country, Shapira said.
The major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases that accompany obesity.
According to the bible of psychiatric diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least twice a week, on average.
The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.
"I know I was motivated to gain weight when I got out of the hospital, but it wore off," she says.
Montaner, her husband and her ex-husband, Amanda's father, all had health insurance, but the three plans together didn't come close to covering the cost of treatment.
But for now, the materials are sitting on the same 11 pallets they were shipped to her on.
"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability to shortcut a full assessment."
Indeed Sehnsucht is open to everyone, which helps the owners make money, at least enough to be encouraged by in the establishment's early stages.
The director of the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute, the author is a frequent guest on TV and radio shows, including "CBS This Morning," "Today," "Oprah" and "48 Hours."
Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio of female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2.
Diagnosing psychiatric conditions is more of an art than a science, and the Not Otherwise Specified label reflects the imprecision of that art.
But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week, then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa."
The condition, caused by the way the brain regulates the reproductive system, can also affect some women who are overly thin.
She is appalled they get on the Internet in the first place.
"The main idea of my book is that you can't change your relationship with food or your body until you change the way you relate to people in general.
The pro-Ana and pro-Mia sites also spurred an online movement to warn people of the sites.
Since then, a long period of therapy has begun bearing fruit, she explained recently, sitting on one of two huge lounge chairs placed in the restaurant's entrance to make the clients "feel at home".
"One of her peers turned to her and told her she needed to go to treatment," Jones says.
Emma, who was in a foggy state when she was brought to the hospital, somehow remembered to bring her "comfort foods" with her.
That type of encouragement alarms the anorexia association and other groups that are asking: What can be more harmful than encouraging people to stop eating?
The injections raised the women's leptin levels to those of normal women or higher.
"Women can feel shameful because many of the behaviors -- like the binging and purging chewing and spitting out and over-exercising -- are not understood," says Tully, who sees several adults with eating disorders each week.
"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or diuretics to control weight," Keel wrote in an e-mail message.
Five of the remaining seven showed promising results, according to the study.
The lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher -- from 1.1 to 4.2 percent of women -- with a similar age and sex distribution.
In the meantime, people like Amanda will continue the daily struggle to keep their disorder in check.
The names of the dishes are often poetic.
Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
As motivated as she was in her quest to look perfect, she was just as determined to beat the eating disorder.
The images offer what the sites claim is "thinspiration" in times of weakness.
The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.
From her bed in the intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of Austin in August, Emma talked about her journey to be "perfect," which to her meant being rail thin.
For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every Thanksgiving?
Because no laboratory tests or other objective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the American Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter of the line between normal and abnormal.
"I'm the only specialist in the area," Strickler said.
But she is anorexic and has suffered from the disease, and bulimia, on and off since she was 14.
For now, she's winning, and the only thing adorning her fingers these days is a wedding ring with the words "I Love You," from husband Ronnie Harsh.
Amanda Meador, now Amanda Harsh, is married, has two children, and lives in Savannah, Ga. She's eating right and healthy, Montaner said, but the recovery process has been fraught with frustration, expensive therapy and a relapse after the children were born.
She lost 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds), then put the weight all back on again in no time and was admitted to hospital for three months in 2003.
But she expressed concern that the term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.
The beginnings of Emma's anorexia is a sensitive topic for her.
With the manual continually under revision, the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is the place where new diagnoses emerge.
The temptation to overeat will strike most of us during the holiday season, but for those who suffer from a binge-eating disorder, holiday feasting can be self-inflicted hell.
Thousands of Americans notice friends or daughters going beyond skinny to skeletal, and the urge to confront loved ones showing signs of anorexia _ "Will you please just eat?!"
Binge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as indulging in an occasional binge at the table or "grazing" through an array of buffet offerings.
Next to the entry is a photo of a woman in a crop top with every rib bone showing.
Boys noticed her more, and the leaner body paid off on the soccer field.
She carried baggies with her to restaurants during family meals to sneak the food off her plate.
Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women stop menstruating.
With her white chef's hat, Claudia looks at home in the kitchen of this Berlin restaurant, but her culinary talents are being used to feed people who, like her, suffer from eating disorders.
They helped her find an identity, albeit one that led her to the emergency room in Austin.
The new work on leptin may offer clues to the condition's cause.
She exercises to the point of exhaustion five mornings a week because, though she is bone-thin, she thinks her thighs are too flabby.
Much is at stake in whether a condition is elevated to the status of a full-fledged diagnosis.
The disorder is much like bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.
The cooking?
"Food is the drug we all must quit," wrote someone going by the name of Thai in a pro-Ana journal.
The attention drove her to lose more weight.
"What is important is that the girls take the first step, that they at least have a taste.
The same when you're listening to music -- close your eyes and really take it in.
She settled for a facility in Florida that the family could afford.
When Montaner looked for help, she found that at the time, Waco did not have a specialist in eating disorder therapy.
But the damage didn't come from turning wrenches in tight quarters under the hood of a car.
Katja and Claudia consider that they have recovered and began helping others like them last month by opening the first restaurant in Germany, and perhaps in all of Europe, where anorexics and bulimics can eat without feeling ashamed.
The materials include handouts, posters and booklets with information on the disease, how to get help and, most importantly, Montaner said, contact information on each piece.
These factors can act as reminders and cause the eating disorder to resurface.
"A lot of kids think they can save the person themselves; if they just meet and have sleep-overs and talk about this and teach them how to eat, it will be OK," Scarano-Osika said.
Slowly, however, she heeded the advice that other site visitors offered: Food is the enemy.
Anorexia nervosa, from the Greek word meaning "loss of appetite", is an affliction stemming from a fear of gaining weight and leads sufferers to deny their hunger and essentially starve themselves.
But that's not the case.
Children star in one out of every three commercials on Italian television, and 40 percent of all ads sell food products, according to the study by Rome's Sapienza university.
Some 30 or so people with eating disorders have hesitantly pushed their way through the doors at Sehnsucht in the month since it opened.
"Ana's got me," she said in the hospital.
"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the Not Otherwise Specified category," said Dr. Michael First, associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.
"Wolf's Hunger" describes a lamb dish, "d to make up five to 10 percent of anorexics but their numbers are on the rise.
Those with the disorder frequently eat large amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their eating.
The family needs to know she's just getting started."
In the 1980s, there was an effort to include "sadistic personality disorder."
The couple is in counseling.
"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of symptoms that normal people have."
The hosts of such Web sites, experts think are female anorexics who find support for their own conditions through the forums they lead.
It is not the intention of people who host these sites, but they are helping people commit suicide," she says.
"It is important to stress, however, that eating disorders are not about food and weight.
Whether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Though Emma started dieting on her own, the sites pushed her over the edge.
But psychiatrists would say that neither one falls into the strict definition of anorexia nervosa, the most severe eating disorder, or its relative, bulimia nervosa.
An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating disorders.
Hard as it may be to do so, Bunnell said, friends and family have to accept that they are powerless.
The striving for perfection set in.
According to Thomas Falbesaner, a medical expert on anorexia and bulimia, the establishment could be helpful as "a reserved space for people who are returning to a normal life, but who are still sensitive about food."
Instead, she suggests talking to friends and family to organize an intervention in a comfortable place.
Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be considered normal.
According to the NEDA, 80 percent of adolescent girls feel bad about their bodies, and 28 percent of boys are dissatisfied with their weight.
Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder in which the sufferer becomes exceedingly thin and still believes he or she is overweight.
The family has moved around to several schools, including one in Florida, to get away from harassment and physical threats made against Emma because she has two gay moms.
To have a better chance at recovery, Emma and her family must deal with complicated issues plaguing the family for years.
She struggled at first and wanted to come back to Austin.
She plans on calling it "The Haven."
Mental health officials have estimated that 0.5 percent to 3.7 percent of females will suffer from the potentially life-threatening disorder in their lifetime.
And the shame can by magnified for older people, says Tully.
"You want to avoid getting into a full frontal assault because that almost always ends badly," said Dr. Doug Bunnell, a clinical psychologist and board president of the National Eating Disorders Association.
And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much more will be known, Keel said.
Trapped in a world of food haters obsessed with body image, Emma had explored the supportive Web sites and their chat rooms on her home computer.
Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term "mixed eating disorder" over EDNOS.
"I can see now how bad they are," Emma says of the sites she once frequented.
Each has already suffered some of the permanent effects associated with the disease -- which can include weakened hearts, severe osteoporosis, teeth that break easily, brittle bones, loss of stamina and, most likely, a shortened life span, doctors say.
She says she made "my lifestyle choice" and was a "proud anorexic" -- the moniker for pro-Ana followers.
The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must be affected, he said.
About one out of every five people with an eating disorder will die from the disease.
In many cases, it's about continuing control, as is the case with
The obsession with one's body provides an escape from dealing with the real underlying issues," Willard says.
"When you're sitting with your son, if you are (really experiencing the moment), that will lead to a feeling of fullness.
The American Psychiatric Association's manual has a Not Otherwise Specified category for many disorders, whenever symptoms are so vague, so mild or so untreatable that it doesn't seem to warrant the full-fledged diagnosis.
On the Net:
Online search results for "pro-Ana" include sites warning of the dangers of anorexia.
Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of bulimia, so does purging disorder.
Three of the women, one of whom had not had a period in 14 years, ovulated and had menstrual bleeding.
"People who go to these sites are motivated by the images.
Years of claiming she wasn't hungry, eating small meals such as an apple and a salad, running errands or taking a walk while her co-workers went to lunch or purging when she ate more than made her comfortable were all part of Hecht's routine.
"This represents essentially a new era for leptin," said Dr. Jean Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone.
The other group had no prior history of eating disorders, but a life event -- a divorce, loss of parent or job -- triggered an eating disorder.
"I never got the help that my daughter is getting now," she says.
Kearney-Cooke says our culture has taught us that the more we do, the more we'll get out of life.
For instance, the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a variant of autism, was pulled from a collection of disorders previously labeled Pervasive Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
"The question is how, at mid-life, can you develop a stronger and healthier body and self, not just be busy trying to sculpt your body into impossible weights and shapes."
When a new category is created in the manual, he said, "you're trying to identify a category that will help patients get treatment."
It has been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss programs have a binge-eating disorder.
"The real difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much more than normal in a short period of time, often less than two hours.
(One woman dropped out of the study.)
Poor body image dating back to a swim meet Amanda won when she was 7 led to her battle with eating disorders, Montaner said.
"It's no longer about control or the desire to be skinny," says Hecht.
"She climbed out of the pool, and some kid standing nearby said, 'Gee, I didn't know Shamu was swimming today,' " Montaner said.
"Then I went to college to play basketball and that, along with (academics), became overwhelming."
Hecht says she doesn't talk about her eating disorder with her children, but she knows they love her and want her to stop.
"This is the matter of what we call false positives," First said.
Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, even though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs only 99 pounds.
It was originally thought that increasing leptin might suppress the appetites of obese people.
"You can be sexy and attractive in mid-life, but that doesn't mean you'll have to be the same size you were when you got married," she says.
These criteria have to be met before binge eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out of the EDNOS grab bag.
Despite her brush with death, she believed she was in control of one thing: losing weight.
The gag reflex caused her teeth to clamp down as she yanked her hand out, biting into her fingers as she vomited.
"School nurses and counselors don't have the information needed when a student, teacher, coach or family member comes to them for help."
"I will never forget the look in her face," Montaner said.
Today it is 1-to-6.
One study looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the members had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.
According to the National Eating Disorder Association, about 7 million U.S. females and 1 million males suffer from an eating disorder.
Describing how she survived on a dangerously low 300 calories a day, the girl with an IQ of 143 says she became an expert on vitamin supplements that helped keep her alive.
The encouragement is often accompanied by photos of stick-like models.
In October alone, the group persuaded Internet providers to remove 58 pro-Ana and pro-Mia (short for bulimia) sites.
Similarly, Walsh said, "we have people who are obese and binge but don't vomit," so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia nervosa, which requires both binging and purging.
But Anne Ducharme-Jones, an Austin psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorders and treated Emma, was not confident about the girl's chances for successful recovery as an outpatient.
The prognosis for Emma's recovery is guarded.
Emma, who once carried 150 pounds on her 5-foot-5 athletic frame and was teased about being chunky, succeeded over a year's time in dropping pounds, winning the praise of boys who thought she looked hot and girls who envied her body.
"But," he continued, "you're worried that this category is going to be applied to normal people as well."
She decided later to withhold her name to avoid more stress on her family.
"Looking back on it now, I learned to lie, and that was something I didn't do before," she says.
Most significantly, she says, the disease rules her social life.
"In the long term, this is very damaging for children."
While the reasons for adult eating disorders vary widely, a majority of sufferers, if not previously anorexic or bulimic, have dealt with weight issues at some point in their lives, says Alger-Mayer.
A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating disorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a placebo binged less often and also lost weight.
"That letter just woke me up," said the friend, an anorexic who wants to remain anonymous.
Second, there has to be evidence of an existing and effective treatment.
"We have people in that category with anorexia nervosa," but they still menstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal diagnosis.
Many of the sites no longer exist, but many still offer this type of advice: "Curl up in a ball if you have hunger pains."
So that they don't feel stigmatised, nothing out front or in the entryway suggests that people are entering a restaurant that caters for those with special needs.
That was going to make me perfect," she says.
When a hospital psychiatrist recommended that her daughter go to an acute-care center for treatment, Montaner discovered that Texas had no such facility dedicated to eating disorders.
Emma talked openly and initially agreed her real name could be used in the newspaper.
"I started to have more and more mid-life women who had eating disorders,' she explains.
Her husband was her caretaker when her health got so bad she couldn't walk herself to the bathroom.
Emma left the hospital after eight days and began counseling and participation in a peer treatment group.
People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.
But when that wasn't enough, she went online to learn how to lose more weight "safely."
She thought Emma needed to go to an inpatient facility.
"Especially as an adult, you know you are a smart person, and intellectually it is the dumbest thing," says Walker.
She won't divulge what spurred the dieting because she says she doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
One function of leptin, which was discovered in 1994, is to regulate appetite.
Bunnell advises having a folder at the ready with names of medical professionals and helpful Web addresses.
The researchers gave injections of Amgen's synthetic leptin to eight competitive women athletes, all with hypothalamic amenorrhea.
She was down to 96 pounds.
Chan, at the Beth Israel medical center, said researchers are already planning a longer study of a larger group of women.
Not only do they offer support and encouragement to continue, but the sites offer competition for how low they can weigh and how little they can eat.
Type in the right search words on Google and nearly 5,000 results are displayed.
She tricked them by strapping ankle weights under her pant legs, using the advice of Web sites known collectively as "pro-Ana" (Ana is short for anorexia).
Emma saw the material as a real education in eating healthier.
"There was also an incident not long after that when she was in choir and someone told her she should be wearing a tent rather than a robe.
It relates to a kind of diagnosis-creep.
Researchers said they envisioned possible fertility treatments, help for thin athletes at risk of bone fractures, and restoration of menstruation to patients recovering from anorexia.
A former anorexic and bulimic who did not receive professional treatment as a young woman, she had seen the signs for months.
But Kearney-Cooke says that needn't be the case.
"Lying goes with the illness, until you are ready to stop denying that you are ill."
Lisa Roy tried to stay non-confrontational in her letter to her old college friend.
"We traditionally think of anorexia and bulimia affecting those of college or high school age, but I found that they were also affecting two groups of middle-aged women as well."
Nutritional counseling is a valuable part of the program," clinical director Susan Willard says.
Emma says she realized how sick she was when she began stuffing food down the sofa.
Albany's Rebecca Walker.

She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6 p.m. she eats nonstop, whatever she can get her hands on.
The first group included those who'd had an eating problem in their youth but had resolved it.
Begin, she advises, by establishing a realistic weight and shape for yourself, based on genetics and how much time you're willing to exercise.
Bulimia, which like anorexia is predominantly contracted by women, is a virtual food obsession that leads to eating binges followed by acts to make up for it like self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise.
As First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a stand-alone diagnosis.
Using grant money to help with expenses, Montaner began traveling the state, speaking at other schools about eating disorders.
The 29-year-old started restricting her food consumption and exercising excessively while a freshman in college.
"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all that you are thinking about," he said.
I can't do this to them anymore," she said.
The teen kept purging until she was caught by her brother, who told their mother.
"If anything, and after all this is over, I will have learned to become a healthy eater," she said.
"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality disorder," he said, "but if there's no treatment, what would be the point?"
"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment, hindering research," he said.
Six years later, she still keeps the letter.
Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS category.
I looked in the mirror and I looked OK, but when I saw still pictures of me I looked sick.
Other battles Montaner has waged include seeking a change in state legislation that would force insurance companies to pay for treatment of eating disorders.
This week, Emma is finishing a 30-day program at an out-of-state hospital that specializes in eating disorders.
"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and treatable," Shapira said.
The turning point came in late October.
But she offers a crucial warning to friends: Do not try to "save" someone on your own.
This is how Emma, 15, and a fan of Web sites promoting anorexia, nearly starved herself to death:
Her appetite began to disappear when her parents split up while she was a teenager.
But studies found heavy people tended to have plenty of leptin and adding more didn't help.
"She's got a long way to go.
Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next edition, which came out in 1987.
Instead these women, and thousands like them, would fall into a category that doctors have been relying on for years, a vague nondiagnosis known by the acronym EDNOS: eating disorder not otherwise specified.
Before she left home for treatment, Emma was feeling guilty that her illness was stressing out her family.
"You cannot personally put yourself on the hook for it," he said.
It started right after Sept. 11, 2001, by eating healthier food, and the pounds came off.
"All the knowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a week.
Montaner said she still couldn't believe it, but this time she confronted her daughter.
With an anonymous $64,000 donation, she had enough educational materials published to send to all 20 Education Service Centers in Texas.
They pushed her to eat.
