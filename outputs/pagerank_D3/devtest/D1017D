The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake the coast by the middle of the week.
The National Hurricane Center said Floyd was 470 miles east-southeast of Miami this afternoon, with wind around the eye blowing at 155 mph.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
MIAMI (AP) -- As Hurricane Floyd neared the strength of a Category 5 storm today and headed west, thousands of coastal residents were ordered to evacuate and NASA began moving workers out of the low-lying Kennedy Space Center.
NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday.
As the storm approached, the weather along the South Florida beaches as far north as Palm Beach was balmy and breezy _ a perfect day.
From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
Because of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane watch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way from the Miami area northward into Georgia, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in Miami.
Though not as large as Floyd, Gert, the fifth hurricane of the season, was expected to pound through the Atlantic with winds well over 100 mph.
At 8 p.m. EDT, Floyd was about 370 miles east of San Salvador in the central Bahamas, and was headed almost due west at 14 mph.
``We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that.''
When Hurricane Andrew struck southern Miami-Dade County in 1992, it was a Category 4 storm with 150 mph sustained wind and 200 mph gusts.
Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
Hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles from the storm's center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles.
Tropical-force winds extend 175 miles from the center, while hurricane gales reach out 105 miles, the hurricane center said.
At 2 p.m., Floyd's center was about 90 miles east of San Salvador in the central Bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast of Miami.
``We're going to live and hope -- that's what it's going to take,'' NASA spokesman George Diller said.
Most of those counties don't have population inland, they sit right on the coast, so it's going to be pretty devastating as far as who is going to get hit.''
``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.''
A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.

``It runs 700 miles in all directions,'' he said of the storm's size, noting that the hurricane-force winds extend 120 miles from its eye.
A hurricane warning was issued north to Brunswick late Monday afternoon and a watch was extended as far up the coast as Savannah.
``Andrew hit Miami in the middle of the night and it was haunting.
Hurricane-force winds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday.
``We've been fortunate so many times before and we're hoping we'll be lucky again.''
``We're doing the same thing as everyone else: We're watching it,'' O'Brien said.
``We are going to feel it,'' he said.
``The federal government is being not just reactive to events and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,'' Suiter said.
``The federal government is being not just reactive to events and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,'' Suiter said.
In a frightening scenario, the hurricane could turn north just as the most powerful winds surrounding the eye make landfall, sending the most destructive part of the hurricane along the coast, meteorologists said.
"The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.
Hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with tropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles.
At 14:00 GMT, the center of the hurricane was about 330 kilometers east-northeast of Barbuda at latitude 19.1 north, longitude 58.9 west, the NHC said.
Gert's center was located about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
At 11 a.m. EDT, Gert's center was about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
We're doing it now in anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.

If it stays on its current path, Floyd would hit the coast of Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach.
Floyd was moving due west at nearly 14 mph today, but was expected to begin gradually turning by evening, initially taking a west-northwest course.
Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph.
``We're the only counties that have barrier islands with a lot of people on them,'' Abel said.
``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the other things ready to move out to the area.
``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the other things ready to move out to the area.
``We know we're supposed to get hurricane-force winds and a storm surge of 9 to 16 feet above normal tide, because Floyd waited so long to start turning north,'' Abel said.
It was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to gradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a further turn toward the northwest on Tuesday.
That storm, which developed into a full-fledged hurricane Monday, was expected to push through the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later this week, and _ if it stays on course _ eventually threaten Florida or the east coast.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.

WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Tropical storm Floyd strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United States.
It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 mph.
It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 mph.
That put it on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing extreme damage.
Tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and forecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight Sunday.
``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.
``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said.
``We're still hoping it will turn more to the northeast,'' she said.
``The whole thing is where it's going to go.''
In Savannah, a mandatory evacuation for low-lying areas was to go into effect at 8 a.m. today and for all of Chatham County by noon.
The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be a problem.
It was on the verge of being a category 5, the most powerful, as of Monday evening, with the power to turn houses into rubble and splinters if it makes landfall.
Because it was still too soon to more accurately estimate the storm's landfall, the entire state of Florida was placed under a hurricane warning.
Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm.
``This would send hurricane-force winds over much of Florida, depending on its exact track,'' Kimberlain said.
In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's center, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already saturated, and that there could be heavy flooding.
``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management Agency's executive associate director.
``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management Agency's executive associate director.
``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County, which ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today.
WASHINGTON _ This could be the storm FEMA Director James Lee Witt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: a catastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to the Carolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of miles long.
Coastal officials planned to go to a mandatory evacuation, based on overnight reports from the National Hurricane Center.
Mandatory evacuations were ordered in exposed coastal areas of both the Bahamas and Florida's Brevard County.
More than 200,000 people on Florida's east-central coast were told to evacuate, and another 200,000 were evacuated from coastal areas of Miami-Dade County.
In the middle of the watch area, Florida's Brevard County ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today.
Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.
All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that Hurricane Floyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of low pressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead of making landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, its dangerous eye offshore.
Floyd, already a major Category 4 storm with 155 mile an hour sustained winds and gusts of up to 190 miles an hour, would be upgraded to a Category 5 storm if its winds increase to 156 miles an hour.
It was moving toward the west at nearly 20 mph.
That came ashore with sustained wind of 85 mph.
THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan.
``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going, it'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and what to plan for.''
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and what to plan for.''
``This is the most serious threat to coastal Georgia and the whole east coast since Hurricane Hugo in 1989,'' said Ed Abel, chief of Glynn County's emergency management agency.
``We've tried to prepare for the worst possible case, and this is one of those cases,'' said Witt, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency after concluding a video conference with emergency teams spread out across the country.
The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane ``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'd never see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction could cover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and the pounding it's going to take.''
While forecasters say they can't predict where Floyd will go after Tuesday, they said Floyd's center could reach the East Coast by Thursday at its current speed.
Water managers and county emergency workers were on alert, while some anxious people in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast stocked up on storm supplies.
FEMA officials say that regardless of where Hurricane Floyd strikes, the federal response will be far different from the tardy answer to Hurricane Andrew seven years ago.
The space is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be devastating.
As far north as Jacksonville, people watched in amazement as the huge storm swirled across television screens, larger than the state it was approaching.
MIAMI _ A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive pounded toward Florida Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm would somehow miss their cities.
It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands.
Farther out in the Atlantic, storm Gert reached hurricane strength today, with 75 mph wind at late morning.
Andrew's hurricane-force wind extended out about 25 or 30 miles.
By comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck south Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 billion in damage.
Floyd whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands on Saturday, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
At 5 p.m. Saturday, Floyd was centered about 335 miles northeast of Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan, at latitude 22.7 north and longitude 63.5 west.
``If it keeps coming like it is now, we'll get hit hard,'' Price said.
