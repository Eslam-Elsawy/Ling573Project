   review of what has been done to determine how gent range and other herbicides affected ietnam veterans confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended 24 years ago.
.. officials and many independent researchers caution that there is no certainty that gent range is responsible for the illnesses and birth defects, which can have other causes and can be found in other countries in the region.
 law passed in 1991 calls for the ational cademy of ciences to review new gent range and herbicide studies every two years to determine if the fresh research finds an added connection between the chemicals and disease.
eterans ffairs, which issued a statement praising the ``thorough and impartial work of the committee,'' offers special compensation for 10 diseases listed as linked or possibly linked to herbicide used in ietnam whether veterans can prove exposure or not.

fficials of ietnam's inistry of abor, ar nvalids and ocial ffairs believe more victims now live in ietnam's central and northern provinces than the south, with some families in central ietnam having three to five affected children.
he evidence to support these beliefs is weak, for it is a sad irony of the ietnam ar that those most likely to have been affected by the spraying _ the ietnamese themselves _ have been the least effectively studied.
ut an estimated 1,000 veterans were denied back payments under strict language that required applicants to state that gent range or herbicides were linked to the cause of the disability or death, a hurdle ruled illegal hursday in the class-action lawsuit.

fficials here are convinced that the five teen-agers _ along with tens of thousands of other deformed children of war veterans and exposed civilians _ are the victims of the herbicide and its poisonous residue, dioxin.
ietnamese studies that purport to find excess cancers, birth defects and other illnesses in soldiers and civilians from areas that were sprayed are discounted by estern experts for lack of stringent methodology.

merican herbicides, of which the most prominent was gent range, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps, and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands.

ournalists who inquire about gent range are routinely taken to ``peace villages'' to see malformed children, to an exhibit on health consequences at the medical school in anoi or to a collection of malformed fetuses at an obstetrical hospital in o hi inh ity.
n authoritative study would add to the growing literature on the health effects of herbicides and dioxin, could help the ietnamese decide how to allocate scarce health resources and might shed additional light on the effects of gent range in merican veterans.

he nited tates has put enormous effort into assessing possible harm to merican soldiers but found only limited damage, perhaps because most soldiers had relatively little contact with the chemicals during their short tours of duty.
ver the years, tests conducted by ietnamese and foreign researchers in certain localities here have documented high levels of contamination of breast milk and blood.
eanwhile, the ietnamese troops directly under the spray and civilians who lived in the sprayed areas for years or moved in later, have been studied primarily by ietnamese scientists whose results are not generally accepted by scientists from more advanced nations.
