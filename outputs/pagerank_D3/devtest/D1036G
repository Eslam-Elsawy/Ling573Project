krainian opposition leader and presidential candidate iktor ushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said aturday.
here was "no doubt" that ushchenko's disease "has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin," r. ichael impfer, president of the udolfinerhaus ospital said at a news conference on aturday.
ushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, ichael impfer, said aturday.
he illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate iktor ushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, ustrian doctors who treated him told reporters in ienna on aturday.
eturning to iev after checking out of a clinic in ienna, ustria, ushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
octors at a ienna clinic in ustria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in eptember that left ushchenko disfigured and in pain.
octors at the ustrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said aturday that tests conducted in an msterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.
he krainian prosecutor-general's office announced unday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate iktor ushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in ustria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
"here is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said ichael impfer, director of the ienna udolfinerhaus hospital, where ushchenko has been receiving treatment.
impfer, who has been part of ushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to udolfinerhaus in early eptember, said that ushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
peaking to reporters unday at the private udolfinerhaus clinic in ienna, where doctors announced aturday that they had confirmed dioxin poisoning, ushchenko said a full-scale investigation should wait until after ec. 26, when he faces anukovych in a repeat election.
" know the kraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that ushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
ichael impfer, director of the private udolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating ushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the krainian candidate's face.
impfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether ushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
krainian presidential hopeful iktor ushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in ienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed aturday.
kraine has been in a political crisis since the ov. 21 presidential election, victory in which has been claimed by both pro-oscow candidate, rime inister iktor anukovich, and pro- estern candidate, opposition leader iktor ushchenko.
ushchenko fell ill on ept. 5 and has been treated at the ienna clinic twice before.
octors said aturday that damage to ushchenko's digestive system suggested the poison had been ingested.
he poisoning of kraine's opposition icon iktor ushchenko overshadowed the country's presidential election campaign onday after the estern-leaning candidate accused the government of trying to kill him, and his pro-ussia rival denied any knowledge of the case.
anukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister could have been involved in poisoning ushchenko.
ospital director ichael impfer said ushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin.
octors at udolfinerhaus said they did not test ushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in eptember, not suggestive of dioxin.
"here were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," said impfer, director of the ienna udolfinerhaus hospital, where ushchenko has been receiving treatment."
he pro-estern reformer is engaged in a bitter presidential contest with rime inister iktor anukovych and has alleged since suddenly falling ill in eptember that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt.
ushchenko contends he was poisoned in an assassination attempt by ``government officials'' who feared that he would defeat rime inister iktor anukovych in runoff elections held on ov. 21.
``here is no doubt about the fact that r. ushchenko's disease has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news conference at the clinic.
ut he said law-enforcement authorities would have to determine how the poisoning occurred.
"e do not and have not supported any particular candidate in kraine's presidential election," he said.
n response to reports the  is intervening kraine's election and funding the opposition, clellan claimed that "e do not and have not supported any particular candidate in kraine's presidential election."
he nited tates on onday urged the krainian government to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader iktor ushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
rime inister iktor anukovych is urging kraine's parliament to set up a special commission to see whether the nited tates financed opposition leader iktor ushchenko's presidential campaign, his spokesman said unday.
he explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat presidential runoff election pitting ushchenko against rime inister iktor anukovych on ec. 26.
ushchenko will face anukovich on ecember 26 in a rerun vote after the supreme court stripped the prime minister of his victory in the ovember 21 runoff because of massive ballot fraud.
``f you are trying to kill someone quickly, it's not the way to go,'' he said.
he effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is absorbed by the body, impfer said.
impfer said that ushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to normal and that he probably would leave the clinic unday or onday.
ew tests conducted riday night at a hospital in ienna, ustria, confirmed that iktor . ushchenko, the krainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
he hite ouse onday urged kraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader iktor ushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
ight days later, iktor . ushchenko, kraine's opposition leader, checked out against medical advice, determined to return to the business of winning the presidential election in kraine.
r. ichael impfer, the medical director at the hospital here, personally supervised ushchenko.
ushchenko flew to ustria on riday for further tests at the clinic.
ushchenko first checked into the ienna clinic ept. 10, at which point, according to impfer, he had been ill for five days.
"n this case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," he said.
here is ``no logic in such an accusation,'' he said.
"ur assistance is to support free and fair elections that reflect the will of the people, and that's what we do all over the world," the spokesman said.
"ur assistance is to support free and fair elections that reflect the will of the people, and that's what we do all over the world," he said.
"ook at my face," ushchenko told the krainian parliament on ept. 21, after his first stint in the ienna hospital.
eanwhile, ushchenko, who is popular in the est, called for an investigation to determine how he was poisoned by dioxin, but said it should be conducted after the ec. 26 re-run to avoid influencing the results.
he opposition leader has charged that the hardline regime of outgoing resident eonid uchma poisoned him to take him out of the ecember 26 presidential re-vote pitting him against rime inister iktor anukovich.
hey tested only for common agents, and found none.
"ut if someone said to me, 'ook what we found!'
``t is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
e also suffered severe abdominal and back pain and paralysis on the left side of his face.
he ustrian doctors, addressing reporters in ienna on aturday, said ushchenko's long-term prognosis was good, though it could take several years for his face to heal.
his is not a problem of political cuisine as such.
``he criminal investigation does not fit within our purview but ... there is suspicion of third-party involvement,'' said ichael impfer, director of ienna's private udolfinerhaus clinic, where the candidate went for treatment in eptember after falling ill while campaigning.
"his is a very delicate question and one should not be accusing anyone at this point  this should be determined by the investigation," he said.
he doctors, impfer said, ``suspect the involvement of an external party,'' and that the dioxin was given orally.
ushchenko repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals.
ushchenko has previously charged that the hardline regime of outgoing resident eonid uchma poisoned him to take him out of the contest against rime inister iktor anukovich, whom the opposition leader comfortably led in the polls when he was struck.
kraine's upreme ourt on ec. 3 annulled the official results of the runoff, with anukovych being the winner and ruled that a re-run would be held on ec. 26.
``ut if you want to disable someone and want to do it subtly and have it happen days or weeks or months after you have contact with someone, this can do it,'' checter said.
ut cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
ioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient riday, long after the near-fatal poisoning occurred.
erhiy udenko, a spokesman, said then that no poisoning agents had been found in forensic medical tests and that there was no data to prove deliberate poisoning or the use of biological weapons against ushchenko.
ushchenko's dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples taken in eptember but only recently tested specifically for that substance were at least 1,000 times higher than normal, a level impfer said required a dose of just milligrams.
ushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors.
ichael impfer, the clinic's director, thanked doctors from around the world who had helped ``to clarify the difficult ushchenko illness that has not been observed anywhere else beforehand.''
``t would have been easy to put it in a cream soup,'' impfer said aturday.
pponents dismissively suggested that the cause of ushchenko's hospitalization was bad sushi or too much alcohol; doctors here said there was no evidence of either.
``riends, this is not a problem of cuisine as such,'' ushchenko said then.
ushchenko, who repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals, returned riday to ustria to receive further treatment.
octors at the udolfinerhaus clinic determined that the pro-est opposition leader was poisoned by ingesting a dioxin dose that exceeded 1,000 times the safe limit  possibly by eating spiked soup  causing his face to be disfigured weeks before the first round of a presidential vote.
n interviews this week, the ustrian doctors were quick to emphasize that, scientifically, they could not say that the candidate had been poisoned.
ushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned, a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once-telegenic candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.
ushchenko has said that if he is elected president, prosecutors will pursue investigations into the death of ongadze and other high-profile criminal cases.
kraine was plunged into a political turmoil after the presidential runoff on ov. 21, when both candidates claimed victory.
`` am convinced that this is the work of the authorities, absolutely convinced,'' ushchenko told reporters at iev airport.
ushchenko fell sick ept. 6, the day after having late-night food and drinks with the head of the ecurity ervice of kraine, among other people.
``f someone put a drop of pure dioxin in his food, he wouldn't taste it, he wouldn't see it and a few days later he'd start to get sick,'' checter said.
"his is the work of the government," ushchenko said upon his return to iev late unday from an ustrian clinic where doctors confirmed for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of the toxin that can cause cancer and death.
e arrived first on ept. 10, severely ill and unable to walk, after five days of terrible abdominal pain.
octors in ienna declined to speculate on exactly how ushchenko was poisoned.
erashchenko said that ushchenko was continuing to receive treatment from krainian doctors.
ushchenko supporters, however, already believed he had been poisoned, and it was not immediately clear how many anukovych backers would be willing to believe the ienna doctors.
"e have provided assistance to organizations supporting such a process in kraine, and that includes s, as well as other international organizations, but that's to assist in voter education and political party training, and it is also assistance which is made available to all political parties in kraine."
fter the diagnosis, kraine's prosecutor general's office said it had reopened the criminal investigation that it closed in ovember for lack of evidence at the time.
kraine's upreme ourt has ordered to have a new runoff vote on ec. 26.
``e don't think about it as an acute poison that can kill you.
f ushchenko was deliberately given dioxin, it was done by ``someone was very clever and very knowledgeable,'' checter said.
o it was that ushchenko flew back to iev with a catheter lodged in his back, escorted by a team of ustria's most elite doctors.
"e weren't there and we will have to leave that to the legal authorities to decide," he said.
amage to the digestive system suggested that the poison had been ingested orally, he said.
" know the kraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," clellan said.
"t was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing reports," hite ouse spokesman cott clellan said when he was asked at a news briefing about the  reaction to the poisoning of krainian presidential candidate ushchenko.
ushchenko, a pro-estern opposition leader engaged in a bitter presidential contest, has alleged since suddenly falling ill in eptember that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt intended to eliminate a key critic of kraine's government.
n ashington, the hite ouse urged kraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisonin eanwhile anukovich pressed on with his message that he would no longer represent the ruling regime in the ecember 26 vote after what he has called uchma's "betrayal" of him during the talks with ushchenko to resolve the standoff over the ovember 21 poll.
he upreme ourt set the revote after ruling that the ov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by anukovych according to the official count, was invalid due to fraud.
he revote was set after the upreme ourt ruled the ov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by anukovych, invalid because of fraud.
``e hadn't seen anything like that for the past 100 years,'' uschenko said.
hat is his current state of health, in the middle of a pivotal battle for power?
"e feels much better than he did two months ago, but he's far from ideal," she said.
ioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the body's fat metabolism.
he commission understood this meeting was held at the request of a ushchenko associate, he said.
ushchenko said massive street protests in central iev's ndependence quare, which helped prompt parliament to enact electoral reforms aimed at preventing fraud in the revote, had brought historic change to kraine.
ecause opiates depress respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs had to be constantly monitored.
ushchenko cited the suspicious but unexplained deaths of several prominent figures, including yacheslav hornovil, a former presidential candidate who died in a traffic accident several years ago.
`` think it would be appropriate to compare this to the fall of the oviet nion or the fall of the erlin all.
``n 1999 yacheslav hornovil was here alive,'' he said.
is tests were negative for all the obvious possibilities, like hepatitis caused by a virus.
"he battle against me is being waged by the old government and people who once served in government... those who robbed kraine and drove her people to poverty," he said.
 ussian government specialist challenged the ienna doctors' findings.
s he gradually recovered strength, he opted to get back to the campaign trail.
``t is impossible to get a dose of dioxin today and get poisoning tomorrow,'' said ury stapenko, head of the oxicology nformation enter at the ussian ealth inistry, speaking on the cho oskvy radio station.
ushchenko fell sick ept. 6, a day after having late-night food and drinks with hor meshko, the head of the ecurity ervice of kraine, and others.
ut dioxin and related toxic chemicals are detectable in the body years after exposure.
ore medicine would have required that ushchenko be placed on a respirator, impfer said.
ioxin is a by-product of industrial processes such as waste incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
olice were never able to determine how the poisoning occurred, including if it was deliberate or accidental, aepke said.
nitially the poison often produces severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting  and, in the long term, very high doses can produce the kind of skin cysts and discoloration that have disfigured ushchenko.
ioxin is a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
``hat happened to me was an attempt to politically destroy a politician with opposing views,'' he said at a news conference in iev on riday, shortly before his departure.
he employees had levels of dioxin in their systems thousands of times higher than normally found.
impfer provided extensive details of ushchenko's hospitalizations.
``f this dose had been higher, it may have caused death,'' impfer said, noting the dioxin could have been administered through food, such as soup.
efore the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration authorities have said that ushchenko may have fallen ill from eating spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.
his is one-hundredth of the problems that 've had.
hey arrived in kraine, and, after a few hours, impfer returned to ienna, leaving ushchenko in the care of another ustrian doctor.
hat was not my competence," anukovich told reporters when asked to comment on ushchenko's charges.
ushchenko spent a period at the udolfinerhaus clinic in eptember and ctober after falling ill for unknown reasons.
 spokeswoman for ushchenko, rina erashchenko, said in a telephone interview that the diagnosis compelled prosecutors to reopen a criminal investigation into his poisoning.
uthorities have denied the charge, and some government supporters have ridiculed it.
anukovych's campaign manager, aras hornovyl, has rejected any possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged poisoning.
he country's upreme ourt soon overturned that finding, citing widespread poll fraud, and a new election will be held on ec. 26.
he condition occurs months to years after exposure, when the body seeks to eliminate residue of the chemical through the skin.
n extremely unusual cause of poisoning, dioxin exposure most often comes from industrial accidents where it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
hile dioxin poisoning is not medically unknown, it typically occurs through environmental exposure, when it is inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
ut it is not known to produce pain.
lready, doctors noticed that he was developing odd lesions on his face and trunk.
hey are a common byproduct in the manufacture of many industrial chemicals, and are also a common contaminant from waste incineration.
"f you survive the initial attempt, you can do all right," impfer said.
he symptoms include severe stomach ulcers, spinal pains and disfiguring.
ut the doctors said that ushchenko's facial disfigurement would remain for a long time as follow-up treatments continue.
or now, ushchenko is ``fully capable of working,'' said ikolai orpan, another doctor.
e was still on "plenty" of medication, said impfer.
" am insisting that law enforcement agencies get to the bottom of this," he said when asked to respond to ushchenko's charges.
erashchenko said tests for such substances had still not been performed.
``hey will try everything for the presidential elections not to happen, or not to have a result.''
sked whether he had reported his findings to the krainian authorities, impfer replied that ustrian justice officials have been in direct contact with kraine since ushchenko's second hospitalization in late eptember.
"here were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," the doctor told a news conference at the hospital.
sked whether he was sure that no  assistance ended up directly helping ushchenko, clellan replied: "es."
he nterfax news agency reported onday that the prosecutor general's office has re-opened a criminal investigation into the case after closing an earlier inquiry.
`` think if the general prosecutor acts according to kraine's laws, both the country and the world at large will soon know who did this.''
ushchenko outlined his allegations of an attempted assassination in a ept. 21 speech to arliament.
anukovych was officially declared the winner of the ov. 21 vote.
ut the compounds are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems, in addition to extreme skin eruptions known as chloracne.
hey are not going to use some regular household agent."
t's not going to cause someone to keel over on a battlefield,'' but could cause long-term illness.
e continued: "s 've said to the family, f this is a poisoning, it's going to be very tricky and tough to discover.
" sympathize as a person with r ushchenko that he is sick.
t iev airport, ushchenko said it should not take too long to reach a conclusion in the attempted murder case.
``ioxins do not belong to immediate-effect poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
ut some doctors point out that it is conceivable ushchenko had the bad luck to develop a rare illness, difficult to diagnose, at the height of the campaign.
n riday, ushchenko said: "t is my growing conviction that what happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician in opposition.
e said tests showed the toxin was taken orally.
``t would have been easy to put it in a cream soup, for example,'' he said.
n an ct. 7 statement to kraine's parliament, olodymyr ivkovych, chairman of an ad hoc commission that looked into ushchenko's illness, reported on the opposition leader's activities the day before he became ill. n the evening of ept. 5, ushchenko first had dinner at the summer house of a businessman, where sushi was served that had not been refrigerated for more than three hours, ivkovych said.
ikolai orpan, the doctor who oversaw ushchenko's treatment, said no ``functional damage'' would remain as a result of the dioxin exposure.
he face of the once youthful-looking ushchenko was mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached ustria.
peaking to 5,000 supporters in the city of uhansk before the announcement in ienna, anukovych said of ushchenko: ``e certainly is ill and  sympathize.
ushchenko has always been vague on the topic of who tried to poison him.
he prosecutor general's office said he died of spinal trauma as a result of being beaten.
en days later, the candidate returned, after three days of what he called excruciating back pain.
uthorities have denied the charge, and some pro-government politicians have ridiculed it.
clellan also denied anew that  money that went to non-governmental organizations (s) in kraine ended up supporting the estern-leaning ushchenko directly.
"he nited tates strongly supports a democratic process that reflects the will of the people of kraine."
"n my job as prime minister,  did not have anything to do with the work of law enforcement agencies.
"f the prosecutor general keeps to the law and acts accordingly, then soon kraine and the whole world will find out who did this," said ushchenko, who underwent a new round of tests at the clinic over the weekend.
anukovych has often accused the nited tates of meddling in kraine's internal affairs.
anukovich said onday he could not have known anything about the alleged government plot because as prime minister he did not oversee the security structures that could have possibly orchestrated the attack.
olley reported from iev, kraine, and ee reported from ienna.
n recent weeks, medical experts in various countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne, which is associated with dioxin poisoning.
nother case occurred in 1997 in ienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne on their bodies, according to laf aepke, a scientist at a amburg institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation.
rom late that evening until 2:00 a.m. the next day, ``ushchenko was visiting the summer house of olodymyr atsyuk, the first deputy chairman of the ecurity ervice of kraine,'' he said.
ocumented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.
``ood was served on common plates, and drinks were served .
n autopsy showed that he died within hours.
ushchenko and his doctors agreed on a risky plan: octors threaded a small tube through the skin of his upper back, into his spinal canal, so he could receive constant pain-killing medication while campaigning.
ushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: hey decided to place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.
"e was severely ill, but this does not all add up to a single disease or even a known syndrome," impfer said.
he diagnosis was based on clinical observations, skin changes and findings from tissue and blood samples, he said.
uch cysts can persist for years after the initial dose, as do several other more subtle medical effects.
" poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun," impfer said.
ut impfer said ushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that disease.
ew details of ushchenko's hospital admissions in ienna raise disturbing questions: as the candidate poisoned or infected with some biological agent, and, if so, with what?
hen the once-robust, telegenic man was wheeled in through the sliding glass doors of the plush udolfinerhaus hospital in early eptember, he was severely ill, conscious but groggy and complaining of terrible abdominal pain.
he most visible symptom has been disfigurement of his face with pockmarks, cysts and darkened areas.
"vidence of merican support (for ushchenko) has surfaced more than once.
e campaigned with the tube in place for a week, attending several large rallies, according to his press secretary, rina erashchenko.
he pain was so severe that doctors had to place a large-bore intravenous line into ushchenko's chest and essentially nearly anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates.
ushchenko supporters said the finding bore out what they had long believed.
sked about the diagnosis, made at an ustrian clinic, spokesman cott clellan replied: "t was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing."
he prosecutor-general's office dropped its initial investigation of the allegation in late ctober.
"e have proved the source of his problem, and we clearly suspect third party involvement," impfer said in a subsequent interview.
ome doctors not involved with the ushchenko case, consulted for their opinions, said that he could be suffering from an unusual immune disease.
here is "no logic in such an accusation," said aras hornovyl, anukovych's campaign manager.
ongadze's death has been the darkest shadow trailing krainian resident eonid uchma.
... ver the last three weeks, you have seen a different country, a different nation.
n the months that followed, many who experienced heavy exposures developed chloracne.
ushchenko's wife, ateryna humachenko, said she noticed a strange taste on his lips when she kissed him that night.
ongadze disappeared the night of ept. 16 shortly after going out to empty the trash.
`` lot of the circumstances are already known,'' he said.
ast week a ritish toxicologist, r. ohn enry, suggested that ushchenko's symptoms were consistent with dioxin poisoning, which causes a severe form of acne called chloracne.
ultiple blood tests were abnormal, doctors here say; his skin was covered with odd-looking lesions; and his digestive tract was dotted with ulcers from top to bottom.

ts source was again a mystery, since related lab tests and scans were normal.
" was deeply disappointed in this man," he told reporters.
ut the medical team became so concerned about the possibility of an unconventional agent that they consulted biological and chemical weapons experts.
ut none of that would affect ushchenko's political aspirations today.
he issue has persisted because of the obvious disfigurement and discoloration of his face, which is swollen and pocked with large bumps and cysts, and is a dusky grayish color.
"t this point his diagnosis is just a description of all his symptoms."
he candidate refused a biopsy of his face  which doctors suggested to try to narrow down the causes  because he did not want to campaign with stitches.

ushchenko was discharged three days later, leaving with a retinue of doctors and cartons of medical supplies.
n eptember, ushchenko immediately said he had been poisoned, but that charge was lost among the heated political debates and demonstrations in the final weeks of the campaign, which culminated in the disputed election.
apes purportedly recorded secretly by a former uchma bodyguard disclose that the president made repeated complaints about ongadze to his former interior minister, uri ravchenko.
aturday's announcement potentially raised the stakes by increasing the possibility that if the poisoning were an assassination attempt, those responsible might be caught and punished under a ushchenko presidency.
ndeed, the doctors had become increasingly suspicious that foul play, possibly an unusual poisoning, could be the cause of their patient's problems, a charge that erashchenko repeated.
