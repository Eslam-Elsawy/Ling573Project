That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for the way the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorial center and the museums and the theaters, since the foundation is also charged with "encouraging the development of cultural facilities as part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site."
And Pataki announced that the underground memorial interpretive center, where artifacts and exhibits will tell the story of the trade center and the 2001 and 1993 attacks, will be designed by the Manhattan firm Davis Brody Bond, which is already associated with Michael Arad and Peter Walker on the memorial itself; the Norwegian firm Snohetta, which is working on the museum complex at the trade center site; and Howard-Revis Design of Washington, which specializes in designing exhibits.
The mission of the nonprofit foundation is to oversee and coordinate fund-raising and construction of the memorial and the cultural buildings at the trade center site.
"At the heart of the rebuilding is the creation of a lasting memorial which will honor the memories of those we lost and help tell their story to the world," said New York Governor George Pataki.
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elements as "simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial at the heart of the World Trade Center site."
George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
In describing the memorial -- "Picture the old foundations of the Louvre in France or the catacombs at the Vatican" -- Pataki said the column remnants of the twin towers would be kept visible, "laying bare the very roots of the towers as visitors absorb the meaning of what took place here."
A fragment of granite bearing the name "John" _ all that remains of a memorial to the six people killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Center _ was installed Saturday as the central piece of a new memorial.
The governor said that financing of the memorial should be the "first and most important" priority for the $816 million in federal grants that have yet to be allocated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site and will build the streets, said that height would permit the installation of as many utility lines as are needed within the roadbed, directly above the subway tunnel for the Nos.
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and a foundation director, said, "The board clearly understands the public trust which they have undertaken and are committed to the same level of transparency as the LMDC."

Bush and Bill Clinton would serve as honorary members of the memorial foundation, which will raise money for the memorial and the cultural centers.
Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged their support for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and would serve as honorary members of the board of directors.
The first big pledge may be said to have come last week, when Pataki declared in a speech that the highest priority for the remaining $816 million in unallocated federal grants controlled by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. should be "to guarantee that we have the funds necessary to build the memorial."
To the public, the tough part of designing the memorial may seem to have passed last year with the choice of a concept, the twin voids of "Reflecting Absence," and the selection of architects: Michael Arad, Peter Walker & Partners and Davis Brody Bond.
"The construction of Greenwich Street through the World Trade Center site is another of the complex engineering issues that must be carefully studied and resolved as we move forward with the redevelopment," said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the Port Authority.

He said the memorial will help tell the story of Sept. 11 and the lost lives, so that future generations will understand the enormity of what happened here.

Severed during the clearing of ground zero, many steel and concrete column footings that still outline the perimeters of the twin towers will be made part of the memorial itself, as will a 70-foot-tall, 250-foot-long section of the original slurry wall.
However, it would also mean that Greenwich Street would rise almost 5 feet higher than the memorial plaza.
"The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in the rebuilding effort," Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.
But the foundation was given a broader range of powers in its April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose: "To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and related structures and appurtenances on the site of the World Trade Center."
In a ceremony above the gaping pit remaining from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack that destroyed the complex and the original memorial, an honor guard of Port Authority officers placed the fragment in a 9 1/2-foot-tall (2.9-meter-high) steel pylon shaped like one of the twin towers.

There is not room enough to accommodate a stairway at this location because the footprint of the south tower -- an immovable element in the equation -- is too close to the sidewalk.
