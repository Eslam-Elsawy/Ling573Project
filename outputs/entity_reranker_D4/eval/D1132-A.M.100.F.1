Seventeen Chinese nationals in a wildlife poaching outfit have been caught with 240 protected turtles, most of them dead, in the second such seizure this week, police said Thursday.

Mohamad Sueb said the fisheries department would be prosecuting the Chinese for encroaching in Malaysia's waters and poaching.

The boat is from China, they are of Chinese nationality," he said.

They were the second group of fishermen from China's Hainan island jailed this week for turtle poaching off the waters of Malaysia's eastern Sabah state, with 17 men sentenced on Wednesday for catching 274 of the creatures.
