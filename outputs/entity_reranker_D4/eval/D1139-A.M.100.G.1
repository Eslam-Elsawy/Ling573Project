Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker, the largest vessel ever seized, loaded with crude and carrying 25 crew members off the Kenyan coast, a regional maritime official said on Monday.
Attacks by Somali pirates have surged this year.
The tanker, which is owned by Saudi oil company Aramco, is one of the largest ships to sail the seas.
The Sirius Star is the largest ship ever taken by Somali pirates, though large chemical tankers and freighters have also been hijacked.
Christensen said the Sirius Star was carrying crude, but he could not say how much.
