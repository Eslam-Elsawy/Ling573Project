Recent studies associate lack of sleep with serious health problems such as an increased risk of depression, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

A new study by British researchers reveals that women's health is much more at risk from sleep deprivation than men's.

With sleep deprivation, levels of leptin fall, while ghrelin levels increase.

The researchers found no difference between men sleeping less than 5 hours and those sleeping 7 hours or more.

They surveyed the patients about sleep problems and found that 69 percent of the patients had at least one sleep complaint, and 40 percent had two or more.
