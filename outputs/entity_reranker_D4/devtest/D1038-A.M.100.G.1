Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
"We had to come back here when this happened," she said.
A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
