At least 95,000 people were killed by the tsunami in Indonesia.

Japan has provided some 500 million US dollar fund for tsunami- affected countries including Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion Australian dollars in loans and grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunami disaster.

The Japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit Aceh and North Sumatra provinces to 146 million US dollars, Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yutaka Iimura said on Monday.
