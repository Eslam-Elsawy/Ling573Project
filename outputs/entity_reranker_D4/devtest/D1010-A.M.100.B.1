Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.

Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.

It is the second case since March in which the disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered, the ministry said.
