For many Dutch, the slaying revived painful memories of the 2002 assassination of maverick political leader Pym Fortuyn, another explosive crime mixing Islam and Dutch politics.

Both men had outspoken views on Islam and many other issues and were always trying passionately to stir public debate.
The killing evoked the slaying of the populist right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn, who, like van Gogh, talked openly about taboo subjects, including Islam and immigration.
A memorial called by the mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, was held Tuesday night on Dam Square, in the center of the city.
Environmental activist Volkert van der Graaf shot Fortuyn as he came out of a radio studio.
Another cyclist, described as bearded and wearing Islamic-style clothes, pulled up behind him and opened fire, police said.
The crime was the latest wake-up call for the Netherlands' low-crime but increasingly troubled society, which has struggled to integrate Muslim immigrants.
Dutch Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner said the suspect "acted out of radical Islamic fundamentalist convictions," and added that he had contacts with a group that was under surveillance by the Dutch secret service.
"I abhor his views on Islam and find them hurtful for the Islamic community, but there is no motive that can justify a murder," added Ayhan Tonca of the Dutch organ for contact between Muslims and government.
``People are rather shocked and embarrassed,'' said Yassin Hartog, coordinator of the Islam and Citizenship Foundation, a group that promotes peaceful dialogue.
He also directed television series, wrote columns and books, and had just finished a movie about the assassination of Fortuyn.

"We ask the inhabitants of Amsterdam to keep cool and cope calmly with this murder and to bid farewell in a dignified manner to Theo van Gogh," the Moroccan Municipal Assembly in Amsterdam said, calling the murder despicable.
"I abhor his views on Islam and find them hurtful for the Islamic community, but there is no motive that can justify a murder," he added.
Police said Van Gogh was shot twice as he biked along an Amsterdam street.
Police found that he left a document attached to a knife he used to stab the victim, authorities said.
The film featured four women in see-through robes showing their breasts with texts from the Koran daubed on their bodies and talking about the abuse they had suffered.
The arrests were made after police searched five apartments and seized computer equipment and fundamentalist writings.
Moroccan organisations in The Netherlands condemned the murder and called for calm.
Immigrants often say it is hard to assimilate in a country where many people do not want them.
Van Gogh's hard-edged rhetoric drew criticism; he shared Fortuyn's typically Dutch mix of social liberalism and political conservatism, commentators said.
The center-right government has recently tightened immigration laws and pressed immigrants to try harder to integrate by taking language and citizenship classes.
Many Jewish organisation branded him an anti-Semite and he was generally known as a arch provocateur.

They were six Moroccans, one Algerian and a man having dual Moroccan and Spanish citizenship.
No further details were given and the police would say nothing about a possible motive.
Theo van Gogh, 47, who directed television series and wrote columns and books, courted controversy during his entire career.
Out of a population of 16 million the Netherlands has some 900,000 Muslims and of those some 300,000 are of Moroccan descent.
They expressed fears of possible reprisals against Muslims.
Amsterdam residents held a memorial gathering Tuesday evening at Dam square in the city center.
His death had shocked the people of a country where violent political crime is extremely rare.
Van Gogh, a prolific filmmaker, columnist and writer who dealt with a wide range of subjects but always mocked hypocrisy, also published a book titled "Allah Knows Better," a scathing critique of Islamic militants and clergy, whom he called woman haters.
The crowd was estimated at more than 20,000 people.
Public prosecutor Leo de Wit told a news conference in Amsterdam that the motive was believed to have been his radical Islamic views, basing the assumption on the content of two papers, one stuck on the dagger used to attack the director, the other found on the suspected killer during a search.
About 20 people were detained at another gathering in The Hague after chanting nationalist and anti-Muslim slurs.
``There is a climate that sees people resorting to violence -- that is worrying,'' Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said at a news conference in Amsterdam.
"You cannot just kill people on the street in a brutal way when you disagree with them."
Ayhan Tonca, chairman of the Dutch association for contact between Muslims and government, denounced the killing as "horrific".
In Amsterdam several Moroccan organisations held a protest rally.
Apparently in this country, the habit is to wait until someone dies before taking action.``
The attacker was arrested.
Ikram, a 31-year-old mother, came to the rally with a sign saying 'Muslims against violence'.
Van Gogh's killer was said to have had contacts with the group and allegedly stayed at each of the five homes searched.
The arrested include six Moroccans, an Algerian and a Moroccan with Spanish citizenship, the report said.
Police had looked into the threats against van Gogh but decided they were not solid enough to assign him guards, a Dutch prosecutor told journalists Tuesday.
``Everybody wants to make sure we all stick together, Muslims and non-Muslims.
''It's incredibly stupid that the local authorities in Amsterdam didn't protect van Gogh,`` she added. ''
He then ran into a nearby park, which was quickly cordoned off by police.
The film featured four women who claimed to have been abused by their Muslim husbands and who wore see-through robes showing their breasts, with texts from the Koran scrawled on their bodies.
The letter he left on the filmmaker's body allegedly called for a religious holy war.
...
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called for calm and asked people to let investigators do their job before jumping to conclusions.
He was known as a Muslim activist,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified.
On the other hand ... there are people who wonder if there will be a war against Moroccans," Abdou Menabi, chairman of the Urban Assembly of Moroccans in Amsterdam said, voicing the concerns of many.
``He was very outspoken, but he was not a racist,'' Hartog said.
Despite his controversial views Dutch commentators were quick to condemn the murder as an attack against the freedom of speech.
Donner said the suspect's fundamentalism was evident "from his past and environment."
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's assassination soon after the killing.
The suspect is being held in isolation and cannot receive anybody except his lawyer.
All eight people had already been arrested for suspected terrorist activities in October 2003 but were later released.
Investigators were quoted as saying that the man who shot van Gogh stayed in the apartments of those arrested.
The organisation called on its supporters to come to the special memorial gathering for Van Gogh in Amsterdam Tuesday evening.
"Either he underestimated the danger or he did not want to be scared by it -- I rather think the latter," said Nelleke Noordervliet, a writer who knew van Gogh well.
There are nearly 1 million Muslims in the Netherlands, about 5.5 percent of the population, and recent opinion polls suggest that many Dutch citizens feel threatened by their presence.
The national news service NOS said the suspect was friends with an 18-year-old Muslim, Samir Azzous, who is awaiting trial on charges of planning a terrorist attack on targets including a nuclear reactor and Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
Officially the authorities will not comment on the motives for the brutal killing.
"Is this what we want?
Some 20,000 people gathered in Amsterdam late Tuesday to pay homage to controversial Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh who was murdered in the street.
Both men had controversial views and took part in heated political debate.
That is worrying," Balkenende told a press conference.
He was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the murder.
''Let's allow the investigators to do their jobs.
Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen announced that a memorial gathering for Van Gogh would be held Tuesday at 8:00 pm in Amsterdam's central Dam square, with two minutes of silence to be observed in Van Gogh's memory.

In a recent survey, many Dutch said they fear the growing number of Muslims and the possibility that Islamic militants may be among them.
'," he said.
His murder came at a time of increased tensions in the Netherlands, where many blame violent crime on the Muslim minority, mainly made up of immigrants.
We do not want silence, we want noise," the mayor said.
"After Pim Fortuyn, another person has been killed who held strong views on controversial issues and did not hide them," the popular daily Algemeen Dagblad said.
``This suspect was at least known to the authorities.
Among those who planned to attend were Muslim groups who condemned the killing as barbaric.
He moved on the periphery of a group of extremist Muslims but was not part of the hard core of the group," Dutch Interior Minister Johan Remkes told a press conference.
"I believe they think 'that's the village idiot why would you shoot him?
"Theo van Gogh picked fights with many people, myself included, but that is a right in this country," he added to cheers from the crowd.
Van Gogh had many admirers and critics.
A feminist politician who starred in van Gogh's film accused authorities of failing to prevent a crime foretold.
The friends and family of Van Gogh had asked for people to make as much noise as possible in support of the freedom of speech.
``He's been threatened almost constantly since the summer.
Balkenende described the filmmaker as a man of "outspoken opinions," and added that it would be deplorable for a difference of opinion to lead to murder.
Do we want to live in such a country?
Police kept watch on Van Gogh's house immediately after the film's airing but dropped that precaution because there was no concrete evidence of a threat, public prosecutor Leo de Wit said.
In his final column Van Gogh even likened Cohen, who is Jewish, to a collaborator with the Nazi regime at the time of the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende described Van Gogh as "a man who got involved in public debate and expressed strong opinions."
Van Gogh was someone who took part in the public debate with outspoken opinions, a champion of free speech.
She said people were worried about possible repercussions and the political mood in the country.
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.

"It is an attack against the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, the freedom that allows us all to live together in this country," several big Muslim organisations said in a joint statement.
Muslim organisations in the Netherlands also rushed to reject the killing in similar terms.
People think, `He's the village idiot, so why would I shoot him?'
Close to a million of the country's 16 million people are Muslim immigrants or their descendants.
``We do not want silence,'' he said, ``we want noise.''
He was being treated in hospital and would be questioned later, the authorities said.
The film by Van Gogh, 47, the great-grandson of painter Vincent Van Gogh's brother, was aired in August on Dutch television, drawing the ire of some Muslims.
"We are all so sad and baffled that you can get killed for your opinion," Tilly Hermans, director of the Augustus Publishing, said in a telephone interview.
He called Van Gogh "a champion of the freedom of speech" and lamented the polarization of Dutch society.
He said van Gogh would not have wanted a silent vigil.
In a recent radio interview, Van Gogh dismissed the threats as "not something I worry about."
``On a day like this we are reminded of the murder of Fortuyn,'' he added.
Friends and associates said van Gogh had received anonymous death threats after Dutch television aired his controversial short film ``Submission'' in August.
As he emerged, he fired at the police.
"He often insisted on the need to preserve our freedom of speech.
Hartog, a convert to Islam, said van Gogh's film had deeply insulted many Muslims but that he had been invited to address a meeting of the Moroccan community in Amsterdam.
Hirsi Ali, who has lived under police protection for two years, said she and Van Gogh had received death threats after the film was broadcast.
Thousands gathered Tuesday night for a memorial rally called by Amsterdam's mayor, an event that was accompanied by loud drummers as the rowdy van Gogh would have wanted.
"Theo did not want any police protection," she said of van Gogh in a telephone interview.
It's unacceptable if expressing a free opinion was the reason behind this brutal murder.``
"There are also Dutch people who do bad things," he said.
Then he added: ''The bullet won't come for me.
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende issued a written statement asking the public not to jump to conclusions.
The 10-minute short tells the fictional stories of four women who endure incest, rape, beatings and forced marriages.
The Dutch news media reported that it contained passages from the Quran.
Witnesses told the police that the assailant then stuck a note on his victim's chest with the knife.
The judicial authorities declined to give further information on the content of the papers, with the prosecutor declining to confirm a report that the one found on the suspect's body was a farewell letter.
"The murder could be the start of a spiral in which different communities come to view each other as enemies," the Christian Trouw daily warned Wednesday.
The government has pressed for Dutch language tests and citizenship classes and has announced plans to repatriate up to 26,000 immigrants -- some of them long-time residents -- whose applications for political asylum have been rejected.
Writer-director Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the artist Vincent van Gogh, was attacked shortly before 9 a.m. as he rode his bicycle through Amsterdam's tree-lined streets toward the offices of his production company.
Van Gogh, 47, was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
Van Gogh made many enemies within the Dutch Muslim community with his often-insulting descriptions of Islam.
It was not immediately clear if he had any connections to militant groups, but the police said he was not known to any Dutch law enforcement agency and that he had not been under surveillance.
It was the second political killing to shake this socially tolerant European country in recent years.
Dutch NOS public television reported that the suspect in Van Gogh's murder had ties with a man identified as Samir A., arrested on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack in the Netherlands.
"Van Gogh was provocative but you have to be allowed to provoke people, that is freedom of speech," said Koos, a 21-year old political science student at the gathering.
The murder of Van Gogh immediately brought back memories of the assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002 for many Dutch.
He said he would only report the threats to the police."
"I was debating whether or not to come, but I decided that as a Muslim and as a Moroccan I should take up my responsibility to show that we do not support this act," she told AFP.
``We cannot allow bullets to rule our society because then dialogue is impossible.''
Van Gogh himself had said in an interview with Dutch public radio on Friday that he "could not imagine" that anyone would want to harm him.
The assailant then shot him several more times at close range before stabbing him and placing a note on his body.
On Wednesday many papers compared the killing of van Gogh to the assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
He called van Gogh ``a champion of the freedom of speech,'' and warned against polarization and intolerance in Dutch society.

The suspect in the murder of film maker Theo van Gogh, known for his controversial views on Islam, had ties with a group of extremist Muslims monitored by the intelligence services, the Dutch government said here late Tuesday.
"Escalation is in no one's best interest," a spokesman for a Moroccan group said.
"We are at a crossroads: do we follow the spiral of alienation, polarisation, fear and hate ... or do we make a stand and say 'no more'," asked Dutch Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk, who spoke on behalf of th	   sb/wdb
"This has to end, once and for all," said 20-year-old student Orinta van Lent at the demonstration.
He was killed Tuesday morning while on his way to work in Amsterdam.
Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short TV film, "Submission."
``He was attempting to show in his own way where religious views and liberal views clashed.''
"He did not keep quiet about his convictions, even when they were controversial," Balkenende said in a national address.
Most Dutch radio and television stations have changed their schedules for Tuesday night to pay homage to Van Gogh.
He made the movie with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born refugee who fled an arranged marriage and ended up in the Netherlands, where she is now a member of the Dutch Parliament.
The interior minister would not comment on the reports.
"It is absolutely terrible and reminds everybody of what happened to Pim Fortuyn," Dutch Europe Minister Atzo Nicolai told EU foreign ministers in Brussels.
Late Tuesday Dutch Interior Minister Johan Remkes said the suspect had ties with Islamic extremists in the Netherlands but did not belong to the hard core group of some 150 extremists being monitored by the intelligence services.
The 47-year-old filmmaker, who was the great great nephew of the late 19th-century artist Vincent van Gogh, caused an uproar this summer among the Dutch Muslim community with his short film "Submission" about Islam and women.
His short film "Submission" about Islam and women caused uproar in the Muslim community this summer.
We have to do something," was one of the typical reactions that flooded the Dutch public radio that had interrupted its program on the US election to bring the news of Van Gogh's death.
I've had security around me, so Theo was the easiest target.
Van Gogh had been inundated with threats since the airing of the film, ``Submission,'' in August, said Ali, a Somali refugee.
Van Gogh received many threats after the film was shown but always laughed them off.
Many commentators in the Netherlands immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh and the assassination of Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
Some Muslim activists called van Gogh's film blasphemous.
The Dutch police authorities have arrested eight suspects concerning the killing of the famous film maker Theo van Gogh, Radio Netherlands reported Wednesday.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot stressed that the murder "should not lead to animosity between certain groups in society".

"This is a sad day for the freedom of speech which is the cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law," Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said.
By Wednesday night some 100 witnesses had been questioned by police.
Later Wednesday an Internet condolence register set up for van Gogh was closed down because it was flooded with racist remarks.
After the film was shown on Dutch television in August, Van Gogh received death threats and police stepped up measures to protect him, much against his will.
Muslims, in turn, say new anti-immigration and anti-terrorism laws unfairly discriminate against them.
By coincidence, van Gogh had just completed a lengthy film about the life and ideas of Fortuyn, which was to be released in December.
Asked if she and van Gogh had discussed the death threats, she said: "He told me, 'Ayaan, if they kill me, remember the rule of law has to be protected against extremists."'

Witnesses said a gunman opened fire on Theo van Gogh, 47, as the filmmaker bicycled down Linnaeus Street in the eastern part of the city, then chased him on foot, shot him again and stabbed him.
Fortuyn, who had gained a large following and wanted to become prime minister, was killed by an environmental activist in May 2002, just days before national elections.
"We won't gather for a moment of silence, but to say loud and clear: freedom of expression is dear to us, and it must continue," the city's mayor Job Cohen said.
"We will show loud and clear that freedom of speech is important to us.
Van Gogh's film production company announced Wednesday that he would be cremated next week Tuesday in a memorial service open to the public.
``We will show loud and clear that freedom of speech is important to us,'' declared Job Cohen, Amsterdam's mayor.
The suspect's name was not released, but law enforcement officials said they knew the 26-year-old Dutch-Moroccan for his ties to accused Muslim extremists and his criminal record.
Van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast in September.
``
