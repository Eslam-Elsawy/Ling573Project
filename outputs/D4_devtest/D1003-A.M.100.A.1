In Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming.
More than 100 giant pandas live there.
By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
The government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of Sichuan.
The pandas have been put under state protection in the past four decades since 1962.
