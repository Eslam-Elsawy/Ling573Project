Reinertsen described the incident as "serious and rare".
Daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
Until repairs are completed production has been halted on the Snorre A platform, causing losses of 130,000 barrels per day and on neighboring platform Vigdis, entailing losses of 75,000 bpd.
"At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis will resume," Statoil said in a statement.
Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day.
