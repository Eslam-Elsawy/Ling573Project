The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.

FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also applies to Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.

Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the risk of an individual patient having a heart attack or stroke related to Vioxx is small, the agency also said "there appear to be significant safety concerns."
