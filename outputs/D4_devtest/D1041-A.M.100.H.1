More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.

It is as if the reefs have been bleached.

"It will take a long time to recover."

The new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events.

The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
