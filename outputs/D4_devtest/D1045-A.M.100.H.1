The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River on Wednesday.
China's State Environmental Protection Administration said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
Liu said China was very concerned about possible hazards to Russia and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution.
The water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
