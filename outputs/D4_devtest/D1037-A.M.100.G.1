The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a nonnative and, they hope, disease-resistant species to the bay.
They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.
Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution.
This year, DNR officials expect about 15,000.
Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
