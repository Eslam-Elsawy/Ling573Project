Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the disappearing species, according to the study published by Science magazine Friday.
In the United States, 21 percent of known species are threatened or extinct.
The highest rates of intersex animals were found in frogs collected from 1946 through 1959, when large volumes of DDT were used for mosquito control in Illinois.
Some are threatened for no apparent reason, according to researchers who carried out the three year Global Amphibian Assessment.
The study was organised by the World Conservation Union, Conservation International and NatureServe.
