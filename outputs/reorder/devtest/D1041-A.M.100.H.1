the study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed. more than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the world conservation union (iucn) said friday. using dna analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the persian gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the red sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
