The shutdown of Snorre and production in the nearby Vigdis field cut Norway's production by 205,000 barrels of oil a day, or 6.4 percent of the nation's roughly 3.2 million barrel daily production.
Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
Snorre A, a steel tension-leg platform, was shut down Nov. 28 after a gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180 workers.
