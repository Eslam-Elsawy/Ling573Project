The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
Britain's food safety watchdog ordered the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
