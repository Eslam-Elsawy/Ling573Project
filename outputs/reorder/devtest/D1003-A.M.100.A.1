the reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said. in sichuan and shaanxi provinces, two other habitats of giant pandas, arrow bamboo was also found blooming. the government has set up more than 50 reserves, most in the southwest province of sichuan. since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages. more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in china, with sichuan home to 76 percent of them, according to the state forestry administration.
