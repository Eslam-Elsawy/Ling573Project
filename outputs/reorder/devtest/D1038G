A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
The volcano alert of Mount St. Helens was raised to Level 3, which "indicates we feel an eruption is imminent, or is in progress," said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Tom Pierson from the observatory.
Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
Major compared Friday's ``small explosive eruption'' to the activity that came to be regarded as normal in the six years after the 1980 eruption.
