Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials and paramilitary forces to leave.
Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti.
Pakistan has deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the main gas field near Dera Bugti, since rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen killed eight people in early January and disrupted gas supplies across the country.
