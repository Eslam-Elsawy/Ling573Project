Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested that he had eaten the poison.
The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
This is not a problem of political cuisine as such.
