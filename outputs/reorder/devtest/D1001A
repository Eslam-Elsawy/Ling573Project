The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the students of Columbine, Gore said.
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts from the popular students at Columbine.
