A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.
But Tuesday, John said Deepak Kalpoe told him in jail this weekend that he and his brother dropped Van Der Sloot and Holloway off at the Marriott hotel before they went home.
Van Der Sloot is the son of a Dutch judge.
