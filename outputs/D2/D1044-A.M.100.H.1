The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
"The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale," the agency said in a statement.
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
