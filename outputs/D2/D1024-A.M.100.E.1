About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.
He said that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical weapons.
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human lives.''
According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the factory employed 360 workers.
Four of them were critically hurt, he said.
Then he thought a plane had crashed.
