Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
Fish and Wildlife Service is poised to remove the park's renowned bears from the endangered species list.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
''The only way the bear is going to survive in the Yellowstone Ecosystem is to have public support for it.
``The bears are expanding their numbers and their range.
