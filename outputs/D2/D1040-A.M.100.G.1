The story also said Gary McLarty told his son that "he almost threw up when he heard Bonny Bakley was dead" and he thought Blake was behind it.
``He was tricked by Bonny Lee and he hated her for it,'' Samuels said.
The testimony sought to shore up the account of Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited them to kill his wife.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user who testified that Blake solicited him to kill Bakley, had maintained until six months after the crime that he knew of no such murder plot.
